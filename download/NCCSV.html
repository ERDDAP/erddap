<h2><a class="selfLink" id="Introduction" href="#Introduction" rel="bookmark">Introduction</a></h2>

This document specifies an ASCII CSV text file format that can contain 
all of the information (metadata and data) that can be found in a NetCDF .nc
file that contains a CSV-file-like table of data. The file extension for an
ASCII CSV text file following this specification must be .csv so that 
it can be read easily and correctly into spreadsheet programs like 
Excel and Google Sheets. Bob Simons will write software to convert an
NCCSV file into a NetCDF-3 (and perhaps also a NetCDF-4) .nc file, 
and the reverse, with no loss of information.
Bob Simons has modified 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html"
>ERDDAP</a> 
to support reading and writing this type of file. 


<p>The NCCSV format is designed so that spreadsheet software such as Excel
and Google Sheets can import an NCCSV file as a csv file, with all of the
information in the spreadsheet's cells ready for editing. Or, a spreadsheet
can be created from scratch following the NCCSV conventions.
Regardless of the source of the spreadsheet,
if it is then exported as a .csv file, 
it will conform to the NCCSV specification and no information will be lost.
The only differences between NCCSV files and the analogous spreadsheet
files which follow these conventions are:

<ul>
<li>NCCSV files have values on a line separated by commas.
  <br>Spreadsheets have values on a line in adjacent cells.
<li>Strings in NCCSV files are often surrounded by double quotes.
  <br>Strings in spreadsheets are never surrounded by double quotes. 
<li>Internal double quotes ( " ) in Strings in NCCSV files appear 
  as 2 double quotes.
  <br>Internal double quotes in spreadsheets appear as 1 double quote. 
</ul>
<p>See the <a rel="bookmark" href="#Spreadsheets">Spreadsheet</a>
  section below for more information.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="Streamable" href="#Streamable" rel="bookmark"><strong>Streamable</strong></a> &mdash; 
Like CSV files in general, NCCSV files are streamable. 
Thus, if an NCSV is generated on-the-fly by a data server such as 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html"
>ERDDAP</a>, 
the server can start to stream data to the requester before all of the data
has been gathered. This is a useful and desirable feature. NetCDF files,
by contrast, are not streamable.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="ERDDAP" href="#ERDDAP" rel="bookmark"><strong>ERDDAP</strong></a> &mdash; 
This specification is designed so that NCCSV files and the .nc files
that can be created from them can be used by an 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html"
>ERDDAP data server</a>
(via the  
<a rel="bookmark"
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromNccsvFiles"
>EDDTableFromNccsvFiles</a> 
and 
<a rel="bookmark"
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromNcFiles"
>EDDTableFromNcFiles</a> dataset types), 
but this specification is external to ERDDAP. 
ERDDAP has several required global attributes and many recommended global 
and variable attributes, mostly based on CF and ACDD attributes (see 
<br><a rel="bookmark"
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#globalAttributes"
>https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#globalAttributes</a>).

<p><a class="selfLink" id="Balance" href="#Balance" rel="bookmark"><strong>Balance</strong></a> &mdash; 
The design of the NCCSV format is a balance of several requirements:

<ul>
<li>The files must contain all of the data and metadata that would be in a
tabular NetCDF file, including specific data types.
<li>The files must be able to be read into and then written out of a 
spreadsheet with no loss of information.
<li>The files must be easy for humans to create, edit, read, and understand. 
<li>The files must be able to be unambiguously parsed by computer programs.
</ul>
If some requirement in this document seems odd or picky,
it is probably needed to meet one of these requirements.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="OtherSpecifications" href="#OtherSpecifications" rel="bookmark"><strong>Other Specifications</strong></a> -
This specification refers to several other specifications and libraries 
that it is designed to work with, but this specification is not a part of 
any of those other specifications, nor does it need any changes to them, 
nor does it conflict with them. 
If a detail related to one of these standards is not specified here, 
see the related specification. Notably, this includes:

<ul>
<li>The Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) metadata standard:

<p><a class="selfLink" id="Notation" href="#Notation" rel="bookmark"><strong>Notation</strong></a> -
In this specification, brackets, [ ], denote optional items.


<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="FileStructure" href="#FileStructure" rel="bookmark">File Structure</a></h2>
A complete NCCSV file consists of two sections: the metadata section, 
followed by the data section.

<p>NCCSV files must contain only 7-bit ASCII characters.
Because of this, the character set or encoding used to write and
read the file may be any character set or encoding which is compatible
with the 7-bit ASCII character set, e.g., ISO-8859-1. 
ERDDAP reads and writes NCCSV files with the ISO-8859-1 charset.

<p>NCCSV files may use either newline (\n)
(which is common on Linux and Mac OS X computers)
or carriageReturn plus newline (\r\n) (which is common on Windows computers)
as end-of-line markers, but not both.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="nccsvMetadata" href="#nccsvMetadata" rel="bookmark">.nccsvMetadata</a> &mdash; 
When both the creator and the reader are expecting it, 
it is also possible and sometimes useful to make a variant of an NCCSV file
which contains just the metadata section (including the <kbd>*END_METADATA*</kbd> line).
The result provides a complete description of the file's attributes,
variable names, and data types, 
thus serving the same purpose as the .das plus .dds responses
from an OPeNDAP server. ERDDAP will return this variation
if you request <kbd>fileType=.nccsvMetadata</kbd> from an ERDDAP dataset.


<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="TheMetadataSection" href="#TheMetadataSection" rel="bookmark">The Metadata Section</a></h2>

In an NCCSV file, each line of the metadata section 
uses the format
<br><kbd><a rel="help" href="#variableName">variableName</a>,<a rel="help" href="#attributeName">attributeName</a>,<a rel="help" href="#value">value1</a>[,value2][,value3][,value4][...]</kbd>
<br>Spaces before or after items are not allowed because they cause problems 
when importing the file into spreadsheet programs. 

<p><a class="selfLink" id="Conventions" href="#Conventions" rel="bookmark">Conventions</a> -
The first line of an NCCSV file is the first line of the metadata section and
must have a <a rel="help" href="#GLOBAL"><kbd>*GLOBAL*</kbd></a>
<kbd>Conventions</kbd> attribute listing all of the 
conventions used in the file as a String containing a CSV list, for example:
<br><kbd>*GLOBAL*,Conventions,"COARDS, CF-1.6, ACDD-1.3, NCCSV-1.0"</kbd>
<br>One of the conventions listed must be <kbd>NCCSV-1.0</kbd>, 
which refers to the current version of this specification.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="END_METADATA" href="#END_METADATA" rel="bookmark">*END_METADATA*</a> -
The end of the metadata section of an NCCSV file must be denoted by a 
line with only
<br><kbd>*END_METADATA*</kbd>

<p>It is recommended but not required that all of the attributes for a 
given variable appear on adjacent lines of the metadata section. 
If an NCCSV file is converted into a NetCDF file, the order that the 
variableNames first appear in the metadata section will be the order of
the variables in the NetCDF file.

<p>Optional blank lines are allowed in the metadata section after the required 
first line with 
<kbd><a rel="help" href="#GLOBAL">*GLOBAL*</a> <a rel="help" href="#Conventions">Conventions</a></kbd> 
information (see below)
and before the required last line with <kbd>*END_METADATA*</kbd>. 

<p>If a spreadsheet is created from an NCCSV file, 
the metadata data section will appear with variable names in column A, 
attribute names in column B, and values in column C. 

<p>If a spreadsheet following these conventions is saved as a CSV file, 
there will often be extra commas at the end of the lines in the metadata
section. The software that converts NCCSV files into .nc files will ignore 
the extra commas.


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="variableName" href="#variableName" rel="bookmark">variableName</a></h3>
<i>variableName</i> is the case-sensitive name of a variable in the data file.
All variable names must begin with a 7-bit ASCII letter or underscore and
be composed of 7-bit ASCII letters, underscores, and 7-bit ASCII digits. 
The special variableName 
<a class="selfLink" id="GLOBAL" href="#GLOBAL" rel="bookmark"><kbd>*GLOBAL*</kbd></a> is used to denote global metadata.


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="attributeName" href="#attributeName" rel="bookmark">attributeName</a></h3>
<i>attributeName</i> is the case-sensitive name of an attribute
associated with a variable or <a rel="help" href="#GLOBAL"><kbd>*GLOBAL*</kbd></a>. 
All attribute names must begin with a 7-bit ASCII letter or 
underscore and be composed of 7-bit ASCII letters, underscores,
and 7-bit ASCII digits. 

<p><a class="selfLink" id="SCALAR" href="#SCALAR" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>*SCALAR*</strong></kbd></a> &mdash; 
The special attributeName <kbd>*SCALAR*</kbd>
can be used to create a
scalar data variable and define its value. 
The data type of the <kbd>*SCALAR*</kbd> defines the data type 
for the variable, 
so do not specify a <kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd> attribute for scalar variables. 
Note that there must not be data for the scalar variable in the Data Section
of the NCCSV file. 

<p>For example, to create a scalar variable named "ship" 
with the value "Okeanos Explorer" and a <kbd>cf_role</kbd> attribute, use: 
<br><kbd>ship,*SCALAR*,"Okeanos Explorer"
<br>ship,cf_role,trajectory_id</kbd>
<br>When a scalar data variable is read into ERDDAP, 
the scalar value is converted into a column in the data table with the 
same value on every row.


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="value" href="#value" rel="bookmark">value</a></h3>
<p><i>value</i> is the value of the metadata attribute
and must be an array with one or more of either a 
<kbd>byte, short, int, long, float, double, String,</kbd> or <kbd>char</kbd>. 
No other data types are supported. Attributes with no value will be ignored. 
If there is more than one sub-value, the sub-values must all be of the 
same data type and separated by commas, for example:
<br><kbd>sst,actual_range,0.17f,23.58f</kbd>
<br>If there are multiple String values, use a single String with 
<kbd>\n</kbd> (newline) characters separating the substrings.

<p>The definitions of the attribute data types are:

<ul>
<li><a class="selfLink" id="byte" href="#byte" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>byte</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values (8-bit, signed) must be written with the 
  suffix 'b', e.g., -7b, 0b, 7b . The range of valid byte values is -128 to 127.
  A number that looks like a byte but is invalid (e.g., 128b) 
  will generate an error message. 
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a class="selfLink" id="short" href="#short" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>short</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values (16-bit, signed) must be written with the
  suffix 's', e.g., -30000s, 0s, 30000s. The range of valid short values is 
  -32768 to 32767. A number that looks like a short but is invalid 
  (e.g., 21768s) will generate an error message. 
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a class="selfLink" id="int" href="#int" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>int</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values (32-bit, signed) must be written as JSON ints
  without a decimal point or exponent, but with the suffix 'i', 
  e.g., -12067978i, 0i, 12067978i. The range of valid int values is 
  -2147483648 to 2147483647. A number that looks like an int but is invalid 
  (e.g., 2147483648i) will generate an error message. 
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a class="selfLink" id="long" href="#long" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>long</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values (64-bit, signed, currently supported by 
  NUG and ERDDAP but not yet supported by CF) must be written without 
  a decimal point and with the suffix 'L',
  e.g., -12345678987654321L, 0L, 12345678987654321L . 
  If you use the converting software to convert an NCCSV file with long 
  values into a NetCDF-3 file, any long values will be converted to double values.
  The range of valid long values is -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
  A number that looks like a long but is invalid (e.g., 9223372036854775808L)
  will generate an error message. 
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a class="selfLink" id="float" href="#float" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>float</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values (32-bit) must be written with the suffix 'f'
  and may have a decimal point and/or an exponent, 
  e.g., 0f, 1f, 12.34f, 1e12f, 1.23e+12f, 1.23e12f, 1.87E-7f. 
  Use <kbd>NaNf</kbd> for a float NaN (missing) value. 
  The range of floats is approximately 
  +/-3.40282347E+38f (~7 significant decimal digits). 
  A number that looks like a float but is invalid (e.g., 1.0e39f) 
  will generate an error message.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a class="selfLink" id="double" href="#double" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>double</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values (64-bit) must be written
  with the suffix 'd' and may have a decimal point and/or an exponent, 
  e.g., 0d, 1d, 12.34d, 1e12d, 1.23e+12d, 1.23e12d, 1.87E-7d. 
  Use <kbd>NaNd</kbd> for a double NaN (missing) value. 
  The range of doubles is approximately +/-1.79769313486231570E+308d
  (~15 significant decimal digits). 
  A number that looks like a double but is invalid (e.g., 1.0e309d) 
  will generate an error message. 
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a class="selfLink" id="String" href="#String" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>String</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values are a sequence of UCS-2 characters 
  (i.e., 2-byte Unicode characters, as in Java), 
  which must be written as 7-bit ASCII, JSON-like strings 
  so that non-ASCII characters can be specified. 
  <ul>
  <li>Double quotes (") must be encoded as two double 
    quotes (<kbd>""</kbd>). That's what spreadsheet programs require when 
    reading .csv files. That's what spreadsheet programs write when 
    you save a spreadsheet as a .csv file.
  <li>The special JSON backslash-encoded characters must be encoded as 
    in JSON (notably \n (newline), but also \\ (backslash), 
    \f (formfeed), \t (tab), \r (carriage return) or with the 
    <a rel="help" href="#uhhhh">\u<i>hhhh</i></a> syntax. In a spreadsheet, 
    don't use Alt Enter to specify a new line within a text cell; 
    instead, use \n (2 characters: backslash and 'n') to indicate a new line.
  <li><a class="selfLink" id="uhhhh" href="#uhhhh" rel="bookmark">\u<i>hhhh</i></a> -
    All characters less than character #32 or greater than character #126,
    and not otherwise encoded, must be encoded with the syntax
    <kbd>\u<i>hhhh</i></kbd>, where hhhh is the 4-digit hexadecimal
    number of the character, e.g., the Euro sign is <kbd>\u20AC</kbd>.
    See the code pages referenced at 
    <a rel="bookmark"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"
    >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode<img 
        src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
        title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a> 
    to find the hexadecimal numbers associated with specific Unicode characters,
    or use a software library.
  <li>If the String has a space at the beginning or end, or includes <kbd>"</kbd>
    (double quote) or a comma, or contains values that would otherwise be 
    interpreted as some other data type (e.g., an int), or is the word "null", 
    the entire String must
    be enclosed in double quotes; otherwise, unlike JSON, 
    the enclosing double quotes are optional. 
    We recommend: when in doubt, enclose the entire String in double quotes. 
    Spaces at the beginning or end of a String are strongly discouraged.
  <li>For now, the use of characters greater than #255 is discouraged. 
    NCCSV supports them. ERDDAP supports them internally. Some output file types 
    support them (e.g., .json and .nccsv). 
    But many output file types don't support them.
    For example, NetCDF-3 files do not support such characters because NetCDF files 
    use 1-byte characters and CF currently does not have a system for 
    specifying how Unicode characters are encoded in NetCDF Strings (e.g., UTF-8).
    This will probably improve over time.
    <br>&nbsp;
  </ul>
<li><a class="selfLink" id="char" href="#char" rel="bookmark"><kbd><strong>char</strong></kbd></a>
  attribute values are a single UCS-2 character
  (i.e., 2-byte Unicode characters, as in Java), which must be written
  as 7-bit ASCII, JSON-like characters so that other characters can be specified
  (see the <kbd>String</kbd> definition above for encoding of special characters,
  with the addition of encoding a single quote as \'). 
  Char attribute values must be enclosed in single quotes (the inner quotes)
  and double quotes (the outer quotes), e.g., <kbd>"'a'", "'""'"</kbd> 
  (a double quote character), 
  <kbd>"'\''"</kbd> (a single quote character), <kbd>"'\t'"</kbd> (a tab), 
  <kbd>"'\u20AC'"</kbd> (a Euro character). This system of using 
  single and double quotes is odd and cumbersome, but it is a way to 
  distinguish char values from Strings in a way that works with spreadsheets. 
  A value that looks like a char but is invalid will generate an error message. 
  As with Strings, the use of characters greater than #255 
  is currently discouraged. 
</ul>

<p><a class="selfLink" id="Suffix" href="#Suffix" rel="bookmark"><strong>Suffix</strong></a> &mdash; 
Note that in the attributes section of an NCCSV file, 
all numeric attribute values must have a suffix letter (e.g., 'b')
to identify the numeric data type (e.g., byte). 
But in the data section of an NCCSV file,
numeric data values must never have these suffix letters 
(with the exception of 'L' for long integers) &mdash; 
the data type is specified by the <kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd> attribute for the variable.


<p><a class="selfLink" id="DATA_TYPE" href="#DATA_TYPE" rel="bookmark"><strong>*DATA_TYPE*</strong></a> -
The data type for each non-<a rel="help" href="#SCALAR">scalar</a> 
variable must be specified by a 
<kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd> attribute which can have a value of 
<kbd>byte, short, int, long, float, double, String,</kbd> or <kbd>char</kbd> 
(case insensitive). For example,
<br><kbd>qc_flag,*DATA_TYPE*,byte</kbd>
<br>WARNING: Specifying the correct <kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd> is your responsibility.
Specifying the wrong data type (e.g., <kbd>int</kbd> when you should have 
specified <kbd>float</kbd>) will not generate an error message and may cause 
information to be lost (e.g., float values will be rounded to ints) 
when the NCCSV file is read by ERDDAP or converted into a NetCDF file. 


<p><a class="selfLink" id="charDiscouraged" href="#charDiscouraged" rel="bookmark"><kbd>char</kbd> Discouraged</a> -
The use of <kbd>char</kbd> data values is discouraged because they are not widely
supported in other file types. <kbd>char</kbd> values may be written in the
data section as single characters or as Strings (notably, if you need to
write a special character). If a String is found, the first character of the 
String will be used as the char's value. Zero length Strings and missing values
will be converted to character \uFFFF. Note that NetCDF files only support
single byte chars, so any chars greater than char #255 will be converted to 
'?' when writing NetCDF files. Unless a <kbd>charset</kbd> attribute is used
to specify a different charset for a char variable, the ISO-8859-1 charset
will be used.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="longDiscouraged" href="#longDiscouraged" rel="bookmark"><kbd>long</kbd> Discouraged</a> -
Although many file types (e.g., NetCDF-4 and json) and ERDDAP support
<kbd>long</kbd> data values, the use of <kbd>long</kbd> data values in 
NCCSV files is currently discouraged because they are currently
not supported by Excel, CF and NetCDF-3 files. 
If you want to specify <kbd>long</kbd> data values in an NCCSV file 
(or in the corresponding Excel spreadsheet),
you must use the suffix 'L' so that Excel doesn't treat the numbers as
floating point numbers with lower precision. 
Currently, if an NCCSV files is converted into a NetCDF-3 .nc file, 
<kbd>long</kbd> data values will be converted into <kbd>double</kbd> values,
causing a loss of precision for very large values
(less than -2^53 or greater than 2^53). 

<p><a class="selfLink" id="ERDDAP_Metadata" href="#ERDDAP_Metadata" rel="bookmark"><strong>CF, ACDD, and ERDDAP Metadata</strong></a> -
Since it is envisioned that most NCCSV files, or the .nc files
created from them, will be read into ERDDAP,
it is strongly recommended that NCCSV files include the metadata attributes
which are required or recommended by ERDDAP (see 
<br><a rel="bookmark" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#globalAttributes"
>https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#globalAttributes</a>). 
The attributes are almost all from the CF and ACDD metadata standards and 
serve to properly describe the dataset (who, what, when, where, why, how)
to someone who otherwise knows
nothing about the dataset. Of particular importance, 
almost all numeric variables should have a <kbd>units</kbd> 
attribute with a UDUNITS-compatible value, e.g., 
<br><kbd>sst,units,degree_C</kbd>

<p>It is fine to include additional attributes which are not from the 
CF or ACDD standards or from ERDDAP.


<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="TheDataSection" href="#TheDataSection" rel="bookmark">The Data Section</a></h2>

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="Structure" href="#Structure" rel="bookmark">Structure</a></h3>
The first line of the data section must have a case-sensitive, 
comma-separated list of variable names. 
All of the variables in this list must be described in the metadata section, 
and vice versa (other than <a rel="help" href="#GLOBAL"><kbd>*GLOBAL*</kbd></a> attributes 
and <a rel="help" href="#SCALAR"><kbd>*SCALAR*</kbd></a> variables).

<p>The second through the penultimate lines of the data section must
have a comma-separated list of values. 
Each row of data must have the same number of values as the comma-separated
list of variable names. 
Spaces before or after values are not allowed because they cause problems 
when importing the file into spreadsheet programs.
Each column in this section must contain only values of the <kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd>
specified for that variable by the <kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd>
attribute for that variable.
Unlike in the attributes section, numeric values in the data section 
must not have suffix letters to denote the data type. 
Unlike in the attributes section, char values in the data section
may omit the enclosing single quotes if they are not needed for disambiguation
(thus, ',' and '\'' must be quoted as shown here).
There may be any number of these data rows in an NCCSV file, 
but currently ERDDAP can only read NCCSV files with up to 
about 2 billion rows. 
In general, it is recommended that you split large datasets into
multiple NCCSV data files with fewer than 1 million rows each.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="END_DATA" href="#END_DATA" rel="bookmark"><kbd>*END_DATA*</kbd></a> -
The end of the data section must be denoted by a line with only
<br><kbd>*END_DATA*</kbd>

<p>If there is additional content in the NCCSV file after the
<kbd>*END_DATA*</kbd> line, it will be ignored when the NCCSV file is
converted into an .nc file. Such content is therefore discouraged.

<p>In a spreadsheet following these conventions, 
the variable names and data values will be in multiple columns. 
See the example below.


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="MissingValues" href="#MissingValues" rel="bookmark">Missing Values</a></h3>

<p>Numeric missing values may be written as a numeric value identified by a 
<kbd>missing_value</kbd> or <kbd>_FillValue</kbd> attribute for that variable.
For example, see the second value on this data row:
<br><kbd>Bell M. Shimada,99,123.4</kbd>
<br>This is the recommended way to handle missing values for
byte, short, int, and long variables.

<p>float or double NaN values may be written as <kbd>NaN</kbd>. 
For example, see the second value on this data row:
<br><kbd>Bell M. Shimada,NaN,123.4</kbd>

<p>String and numeric missing values may be indicated by an empty field. 
For example, see the second value on this data row:
<br><kbd>Bell M. Shimada,,123.4</kbd>

<p>For byte, short, int, and long variables,
the NCCSV converter utility and ERDDAP will convert an empty field 
into the maximum allowed value for that data type (e.g., 127 for bytes).
If you do this, be sure to add a <kbd>missing_value</kbd> or 
<kbd>_FillValue</kbd> attribute for that variable to identify this value, 
e.g.,
<br><kbd><i>variableName</i>,_FillValue,127b</kbd>
<br>For float and double variables, an empty field will be converted to NaN.


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="DateTimeValues" href="#DateTimeValues" rel="bookmark">DateTime Values</a></h3>
DateTime values (including date values that don't have a time component)
may be represented as numbers or as Strings in NCCSV files.
A given dateTime variable may only have String values or only numeric values,
not both. The NCCSV software will convert String dateTime values into numeric
dateTime values when creating .nc files (as required by CF).
String dateTime values have the advantage of being easily readable by humans.

<p>DateTime values represented as numeric values must have a
<kbd>units</kbd> attribute which specifies the "<i>units</i> since <i>dateTime</i>" 
as required by CF and specified by UDUNITS, e.g., 
<br><kbd>time,units,seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z</kbd>

<p>DateTime values represented as String values must have a
String <kbd>*DATA_TYPE*</kbd> attribute and a <kbd>units</kbd> attribute
which specifies a dateTime pattern as specified by the 
Java DateTimeFormatter class 
<br>(<a rel="bookmark"
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/time/format/DateTimeFomatter.html"
     >https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/time/format/DateTimeFomatter.html<img 
        src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
        title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>). For example, 
<br><kbd>time,units,yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ</kbd>
<br>All dateTime values for a given data variable must use the same format.
<br>In most cases, the dateTime pattern you need for the <kbd>units</kbd> 
attribute will be a variation of one of these formats:

<ul>
<li>yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ &mdash; which is the ISO 8601:2004(E) dateTime format. 
You may need a shortened version of this,
e.g., yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ (the only recommended format) or yyyy-MM-dd.
If you are changing the format of your dateTime values,
NCCSV strongly recommends that you change to this format (perhaps shortened).
This is the format that ERDDAP will use when it writes NCCSV files.
<li>yyyyMMddHHmmss.SSS &mdash; which is the compact version of the ISO 8601:2004
dateTime format. You may need a shortened version of this, e.g., yyyyMMdd.
<li>M/d/yyyy H:mm:ss.SSS &mdash; which handles US-style dates and dateTimes like
"3/23/2017 16:22:03.000". You may need a shortened version of this,
e.g., M/d/yyyy .
<li>yyyyDDDHHmmssSSS &mdash; which is the year plus the zero-padded
day of the year (e.g, 001 = Jan 1, 365 = Dec 31 in a non-leap year;
this is sometimes erroneously called the Julian date).
You may need a shortened version of this, e.g., yyyyDDD .
</ul>

<p><a class="selfLink" id="Precision" href="#Precision" rel="bookmark">Precision</a> &mdash; 
When a software library converts an .nc file into an NCCSV file,
all dateTime values will be written as Strings with the
ISO 8601:2004(E) dateTime format, e.g., 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z . 
You can control the precision with the ERDDAP-specific attribute
<kbd>time_precision</kbd>. See 
<br><a rel="bookmark" 
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#time_precision"
>https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#time_precision</a>.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="TimeZone" href="#TimeZone" rel="bookmark">Time Zone</a> &mdash; 
The default time zone for dateTime values is the Zulu (or GMT) 
time zone, which has no daylight saving time periods. 
If a dateTime variable has dateTime values from a different time zone,
you must specify this with the ERDDAP-specific attribute <kbd>time_zone</kbd>.
This is a requirement for ERDDAP (see 
<br><a rel="bookmark" 
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#time_zone"
>https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#time_zone</a>).


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="DegreeValues" href="#DegreeValues" rel="bookmark">Degree Values</a></h3>
As required by CF, all degree values (e.g., for longitude and latitude) 
must be specified as decimal-degree double values, 
not as a degree&deg;min'sec" String or as separate variables for 
degrees, minutes, seconds. 
The direction designators N, S, E, and W are not allowed. 
Use negative values for West longitudes and for South latitudes.


<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="DSGFeatureTypes" href="#DSGFeatureTypes" rel="bookmark">DSG Feature Types</a></h2>
An NCCSV file may contain CF Discrete Sampling Geometry 
<br>(<a rel="bookmark" href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries"
>http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries<img 
        src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
        title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>) data. It is the attributes that make this work:

<ol>
<li>As required by CF, the NCCSV file must include a line in the 
  metadata section identifying the <a rel="help" href="#GLOBAL"><kbd>*GLOBAL*</kbd></a>
  featureType attribute, e.g., 
  <br><kbd>*GLOBAL*,featureType,trajectory</kbd>
<li>For use in ERDDAP, the NCCSV file must include a line or lines 
  in the metadata section identifying the <kbd>cf_role=..._id</kbd> variables, e.g.,
  <br><kbd>ship,cf_role,trajectory_id</kbd>
  <br>This is optional for CF, but required in NCCSV.
<li>For use in ERDDAP, the NCCSV file must include a line or lines
  in the metadata section identifying which variables are associated 
  with each timeSeries, trajectory, or profile as required by ERDDAP (see 
<br><a rel="bookmark"
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#cdm_data_type"
>https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#cdm_data_type</a>), e.g.,
  <br><kbd>*GLOBAL*,cdm_trajectory_variables,"ship"</kbd>

<p>Notes:
<ul>
<li>This sample file includes many difficult cases (e.g., <kbd>char</kbd> and 
  <kbd>long</kbd> variables and difficult String values). 
  Most NCCSV files will be much simpler.
<li>The <kbd>license</kbd> line is broken into two lines here, but is just
  one line in the sample file.
<li>\u20AC is the encoding of the Euro character and
  \u00FC is the encoding of &uuml;.
<li>Many Strings in the example are enclosed by double quotes 
  even though they don't have to be,
  e.g., many global attributes including the title, the <kbd>lon units</kbd>
  attribute, and the 3rd line of data.)
<li>It would be clearer and better if the units attribute 
  for the testLong variable were written in double quotes indicating
  it is a String value. But the current representation (<kbd>1</kbd>,
  without quotes) will be interpreted correctly as a String, 
  not an integer, because there is no 'i' suffix.
<li>Unlike other numeric data types, the <kbd>long</kbd> values 
  in the data section have the suffix ('L') that identifies
  their numeric data type.
  This is required to prevent spreadsheets from interpreting the 
  values as floating point numbers and thus losing precision.
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="Spreadsheets" href="#Spreadsheets" rel="bookmark">Spreadsheets</a></h2>

In a spreadsheet, as in an NCCSV file:
<ul>
<li>Write numeric attribute values as specified for NCCSV files
(e.g., with a suffix letter, e.g., 'f', to identify attribute's data type).
<li>In Strings, write all characters less than ASCII character #32 or 
greater than character #126 as either a JSON-like backslashed character
(e.g., <kbd>\n</kbd> for newline) or as the hexadecimal Unicode character number
(case insensitive) with the syntax 
<a rel="help" href="#uhhhh"><kbd>\u<i>hhhh</i></kbd></a> 
(e.g., <kbd>\u20AC</kbd> for the Euro sign). 
Use <kbd>\n</kbd> (2 characters: backslash and 'n') 
to indicate a new line, not Alt Enter.
</ul>

<p>The only differences between NCCSV files and the analogous spreadsheet 
which follow these conventions are:
<ul>
<li>NCCSV files have values on a line separated by commas.
  <br>Spreadsheets have values on a line in adjacent cells.
<li>Strings in NCCSV files are often surrounded by double quotes.
  <br>Strings in spreadsheets are never surrounded by double quotes. 
<li>Internal double quotes ( " ) in Strings in NCCSV files appear as 
  2 double quotes.
  <br>Internal double quotes in spreadsheets appear as 1 double quote. 
</ul>

<p>If a spreadsheet following these conventions is saved as a CSV file, 
there will often be extra commas at the end of many of the lines. 
The software that converts NCCSV files into .nc files will ignore the extra commas.


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="Excel" href="#Excel" rel="bookmark">Excel</a></h3>
<p>To import an NCCSV file into Excel:
<ol>
<li>Choose <kbd>File : Open</kbd> .
<li>Change the file type to <kbd>Text Files (*.prn; *.txt; *.csv)</kbd> .
<li>Search the directories and click on the NCCSV .csv file.
<li>Click <kbd>Open</kbd> .
</ol>

<p>To create an NCCSV file from an Excel spreadsheet:

<ol>
<li>Choose <kbd>File : Save As</kbd> .
<li>Change the <kbd>Save as type:</kbd> to be <kbd>CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)</kbd> .
<li>In response to the compatibility warning, click <kbd>Yes</kbd> .
<li>The resulting .csv file will have extra commas at the end 
  of all the rows other than the CSV rows. You can ignore them.
</ol>

<p>In Excel, the sample NCCSV file above appears as

<p>
<img alt="sampleExcel.png" src="sampleExcel.png" title="">


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="GoogleSheets" href="#GoogleSheets" rel="bookmark">Google Sheets</a></h3>

To import an NCCSV file into Google Sheets:

<ol>
<li>Choose <kbd>File : Open</kbd> .
<li>Choose to <kbd>Upload</kbd> a file and click on 
  <kbd>Upload a file from your computer</kbd> . 
  Select the file, then click <kbd>Open</kbd> .
  <br>
  <br>Or, choose <kbd>My Drive</kbd> and change the file type drop down 
    selection to <kbd>All file types</kbd> . 
    Select the file, then click <kbd>Open</kbd> .
</ol>

<p>To create an NCCSV file from a Google Sheets spreadsheet:

<ol>
<li>Choose <kbd>File : Save As</kbd> .
<li>Change the <kbd>Save as type:</kbd> to be <kbd>CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)</kbd> .
<li>In response to the compatibility warning, click <kbd>Yes</kbd> .
<li>The resulting .csv file will have extra commas at the end of all the rows
  other than the CSV rows. Ignore them. 
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="Problems" href="#Problems" rel="bookmark">Problems/Warnings</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you create an NCCSV file with a text editor or if you create an
  analogous spreadsheet in a spreadsheet program, the text editor
  or the spreadsheet program will not check that you followed these
  conventions correctly. It is up to you to follow these conventions correctly.
<li>The conversion of a spreadsheet following this convention 
  into a csv file (thus, a NCCSV file) will lead to extra commas
  at the end of all the rows other than the CSV data rows. 
  Ignore them.
  The software the converts NCCSV files into .nc files will ignore them.
<li>If an NCCSV file has excess commas at the end of rows, 
  you can remove them by converting the NCCSV file into a NetCDF file 
  and then converting the NetCDF file back into a NCCSV file.
<li>When you try to convert an NCCSV file into a NetCDF file, some errors
  will be detected by the software and will generate error messages,
  causing the conversion to fail. 
  Other problems are hard or impossible to catch and will not 
  generate error messages or warnings. Other problems
  (e.g., excess commas at the end of rows) will be ignored.
  The file converter will do only minimal checking of correctness
  of the resulting NetCDF file, e.g., in regards to CF compliance. 
  It is the file creator's and file user's responsibility to check 
  that the results of the conversion are as desired and correct. 
  Two ways to check are:
  <ul>
  <li>Print the contents of the .nc file with ncdump 
  <br>(<a  href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/newdocs/netcdf/ncdump.html"
     >https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/newdocs/netcdf/ncdump.html<img 
        src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
        title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
     ).
  <li>View the contents of the data in ERDDAP.
