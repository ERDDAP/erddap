<ul>
<li><b>New Features (for users):</b> (None)

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>You probably already know about 
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridFromErddap">EDDGridFromErddap</a>
    and 
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromErddap">EDDTableFromErddap</a>
    which let you link to datasets in other ERDDAPs and have them appear
    in your ERDDAP. User requests for actual data from these datasets get 
    routed invisibly to the source ERDDAP, so the data doesn't flow through your
    system or use your bandwidth. There is now a large list of recommended datasets 
    in the
    <a rel="bookmark"  href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/erddapContent.zip">sample datasets.xml in erddapContent.zip</a>.
    To include them in your ERDDAP, all you have do is copy and paste the 
    ones you want into your datasets.xml.    
    Thanks to Conor Delaney.
  <li>If you compile ERDDAP, you need to add some new .jar files to your 
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#developmentEnvironment">classpath 
    -cp switch</a> for javac and java.
  <li>The new 
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromCassandra">EDDTableFromCassandra</a>
    handles getting data from 
    <a rel="help" 
    href="http://planetcassandra.org/cassandra/">Cassandra<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
    Thanks to Ocean Networks Canada.
  <li>The new 
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromColumnarAsciiFiles">EDDTableFromColumnarAsciiFiles</a>
    handles getting data from ASCII data files with fixed-width columns.
    Thanks to Philippe Makowski.
  <li>All EDDGridFromFiles and EDDTableFromFiles subclasses now use a new 
    method, FileVisitor (added to Java in 1.7) to gather information about the files.
    This may have no benefit for the first gathering of file information
    for a given dataset but seems to have a huge benefit for subsequent gatherings
    if done soon, while the OS still has the information cached. Thanks to NGDC.
    <p>We still recommend: If a dataset has a large number of files (e.g., &gt;1,000), 
    the operating system (and thus EDDGridFromFiles and EDDTableFromFiles)
    will operate much more efficiently if you 
    store the files in a series of subdirectories (one per year,
    or one per month for datasets with very frequent files),
    so that there are never a huge number of files in a given directory.    
  <li>Several small improvements to EDDTableFromAsciiFiles.
  <li>Some improvements to EDDTableFromAsciiServiceNOS, notably to get some
    additional columns of information from the source.
    Thanks to Lynn DeWitt.
  <li>Some small bug fixes related to the ISO 19115 that ERDDAP generates.
    Thanks to Anna Milan.

<h2><a name="changes1.54">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.54 (released 2014-10-24)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features (for users):</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>Some variables now work with time at the milliseconds precision, e.g.,
    2014-10-24T16:41:22.485Z.
    Thanks to Dominic Fuller-Rowell.
  </ul>

<li><b>Small changes/Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Bug fix: with a certain combination of circumstances, EDDGridFromNcFile
    datasets returned data at reduced precision (e.g., floats instead of doubles).
    This could only affect data values with &gt; 8 significant figures.
    My apologies. (And it was a classic computer programming bug: one wrong character.)
    Thanks to Dominic Fuller-Rowell.
  <li>Many small changes.
  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>Griddap datasets now support timestamp axis variables and data variables
     (i.e., variables with time values, but a destinationName other than "time").
     Thanks to Dominic Fuller-Rowell.
  <li>ERDDAP now correctly supports milliseconds time_precision "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z".
     One intentional quirk: 
     when writing times to human-oriented files (e.g., .csv, .tsv, .json, .xhtml),
     ERDDAP uses the specified time_precision if it includes seconds and/or decimal seconds;
     otherwise, it uses seconds time_precision "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" (for consistency
     and backwards compatibility).
     Thanks to Dominic Fuller-Rowell.
  <li>EDDGridFromNcFiles now supports reading String dataVariables.
  <li>.nc files written by griddap can now have String dataVariables.
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml now includes more flush() calls to avoid the problem
    of information not being written to the files. 
    Thanks to Thierry Valero.
  <li>The documentation for GenerateDatasetsXml was improved, notably to point
    out that the -i switch only works if you specify all the answers on the command line
    (e.g., script mode). And script mode is explained.
    Thanks to Thierry Valero.
  <li>ERDDAP no longer allows two variables in a dataset to have the same sourceName.
    (If someone did it before, it probably led to error messages.)
    As before, ERDDAP doesn't allow two variables in a dataset to have the same destinationName.
  </ul>

<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b> (none)

<li><b>Small changes/Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Another (smaller) change to make ERDDAP faster.
  <li>Improvement to ISO 19115 files generated by ERDDAP: added newly recommended
     &lt;gmd:protocol&gt; values (information, search, OPeNDAP:OPeNDAP, 
     ERDDAP:griddap, and ERDDAP:tabledap)
     within &lt;gmd:CI_OnlineResource&gt;.
     Thanks to Derrick Snowden and John Maurer.
  <li>Many small changes.
  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>Bug fix: GenerateDatasetsXml.sh and DasDds.sh weren't in erddap.war for 1.48 and 1.50.
    Now they are. Thanks to Thierry Valero.
  <li>Small changes to some speed tests in TestAll to make them less susceptible to chance.
    Thanks to Terry Rankine.

<h2><a name="changes1.48">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.48 (released 2014-09-04)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>ERDDAP now always creates a tabular dataset, datasetID=allDatasets, 
    which has a table of information about all of the datasets in this ERDDAP.
    It can be queried like any other tabular dataset. This is a useful
    alternative to the current system for getting information about datasets programmatically.
  <li>There are two new output file types for EDDTable and EDDGrid, .csv0 and .tsv0.  
    They are comma- and tab-separated-value files that don't have lines with column names or units. 
    The data starts on the first line.
    They are especially useful for scripts that just want one piece of information from ERDDAP.
  </ul>

<li><b>Small changes/Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Maps can now be made to longitudes in the range -720 to 720. 
  <li>The new .ncml response File Type is available for all EDDGrid datasets.
    It returns the <a rel="help" 
    href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/ncml/">NCML<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>-formatted
    description of the dataset (similar to a combined .dds + .das).
  <li>Bug fix: Saving tabular data to an .nc file was limited to 100,000 values per variable.
    Now it is just limited to 2 GB total file size.
    Thanks to Kevin O'Brien.
  <li>Bug fix: the saveAsMatlab methods now ensure that datasetIDs are converted
    to safe Matlab variable names. 
    But I still strongly recommend that you create datasetIDs that are valid variable names:
    starting with a letter and then just using A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _. 
    See <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#datasetID">datasetID</a>.
    Thanks to Luke Campbell.
  <li>Bug fix in EDDTableFromDatabase: With some types of databases, 
    a NO_DATA response from the database led to a pointless 30 second delay in ERDDAP.
    Thanks to Greg Williams. 
  <li>Bug fix: EDDGrid Make A Graph with Graph Type = lines (or markers or markers and lines)
    forced x axis variable to be time. Now it can be any axis.
    Thanks to Lynn DeWitt.

  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Update Java  
    <br>This version of ERDDAP requires Java 7 or higher, 
    but Java 7 will reach its end-of-life in April 2015 (soon!), 
    so now is a good time to switch to Java 8.
    So Java 8 is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. I test with Java 8.
    Note that Java 6 reached its end-of-life in February 2013 (no more security bug fixes!).
  <li>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Update Tomcat 
    <br>If you use Tomcat, please switch to the latest version of Tomcat.  
    Tomcat 8 is designed to work with Java 8.
  <li>"ERDDAP" is no longer an acronym. Now it is just a name. 
    I don't want the name to highlight ERD. 
    I want ERDDAP to highlight your institution and your data.  
  <li>PLEASE 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#customize">customize
    the appearance of your ERDDAP installation to highlight your institution and your data</a>. 
    With an hour's work, you can make nice improvements that will last forever.  
  <li>In setup.xml, the &lt;displayDiagnosticInfo&gt; option is now always ignored
    and treated as if the value were <tt>false</tt>. 
    <br>RECOMMENDED: Remove the &lt;displayDiagnosticInfo&gt; tag and 
    related info from your setup.xml.
  <li>In setup.xml, the default for &lt;drawLandMask&gt; was "over", but now it is "under", 
    which is a better general default (works well with all datasets). 
  <li>The GenerateDatasetsXml.sh and DadDds.sh Linux scripts now use bash instead of csh,
    and have the extension .sh.
    Thanks to Emilio Mayorga
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml and DasDds now create their own log files 
    (GenerateDatasetsXml.log and  DasDds.log) 
    and output files (GenerateDatasetsXml.out and DadDds.out) in <i>bigParentDirectory</i>/logs/,
    and never put their results on the clipboard.
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml now supports a -i command line parameter which inserts the output 
    into the specified file at a specified place. See the 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#GenerateDatasetsXml">documentation</a>.  Thanks to Terry Rankine.
  <li>EDDTableFromDatabase now supports &lt;columnNameQuotes&gt;&lt;/columnNameQuotes&gt;,
    with valid values " (the default), ', or nothing.
    This character (if any) will be used before and after column names in SQL queries.
    Different types of databases, set up in different ways, will need different column name
    quotation marks. 
  <li>Tabular latitude and longitude variables can now have customized long_name's,
    e.g., Profile Latitude. Previously, they could only be Latitude and Longitude.
  <li>From now on, specify "defaultDataQuery" and "defaultGraphQuery" 
    as attributes in the dataset's global metadata (i.e., &lt;addAtts&gt;), not as separate
    &lt;defaultDataQuery&gt; and &lt;defaultGraphQuery&gt; tags.
    (Although, if you still specify them via the tags,
    ERDDAP will automatically create global attributes with the information.)

<h2><a name="changes1.46">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.46 (released 2013-07-09)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>(None)
  </ul>

<li><b>Small changes/Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Bug fix: In EDDTableFromDatabase, in version 1.44 only, ERDDAP improperly
    quoted the database's table name in SQL statements.  That is now fixed.
    Thanks to Kevin O'Brien.
  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li><b>If you don't modify the standard messages in messages.xml, 
    <br>delete [tomcat]/content/erddap/messages.xml .</b>
    <br>The default messages.xml file is now in the erddap.war file, not erddapContent.zip.  
    So, you no longer need to manually update messages.xml .    

  <li>If you do modify the messages in messages.xml,
    from now on, each time you update ERDDAP, either:
    <ul>
    <li>Make the same changes you made before to the new 
      <br>[tomcat]/webapps/erddap/WEB-INF/classes/gov/noaa/pfel/erddap/util/messages.xml.
      <br>And this one time: delete [tomcat]/content/erddap/messages.xml .
    <li>Or, figure out what has changed in the new messages.xml (via diff), and modify your 
      <br>[tomcat]/content/erddap/messages.xml file accordingly.

<h2><a name="changes1.44">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.44 (released 2013-05-30)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Queries to EDDTable datasets now support <tt>&amp;orderByMin(...)</tt> and <tt>&amp;orderByMinMax(...)</tt>
    (which returns two rows in each group, with the minimum and maximum of the last orderBy value).
    Thanks to Lynn DeWitt.
  <li>There are two new tabledap file types: .ncCFHeader and .ncCFMAHeader 
    (which return the ncdump-like header of the corresponding .ncCF and .ncCFMA file types).
    Thanks to Steve Hankin.
  </ul>

<li><b>Small changes/Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Bug fix: loading the .graph and .html web pages for datasets with lots of time values was slow
    because ERDDAP was slow when generating the time slider options. Now it is always fast.
    Thanks to Michael Barry, OOICI, and Kristian Sebastian Blalid.
  <li>Bug fix: In some EDDTable dataset types, the time constraints were not always handled correctly.
    Now they are.
    Thanks to John Maurer and Kevin O'Brien.
  <li>Bug fix: datasets wouldn't load when all of the subsetVariables were fixed value variables.
    Now they will.
    Thanks to Lynn DeWitt and John Peterson.
  <li>Change: now, all queries for just subset variables act as if <tt>&amp;distinct()</tt> is part of the query.
  <li>Change: now, for queries that include <tt>&amp;.jsonp=<i>functionName</i></tt>, 
    <tt><i>functionName</i></tt> MUST now be a series of 1 or more (period-separated) words.
    Each word must start with an ISO 8859 letter or "_" and be followed
    by 0 or more ISO 8859 letters, digits, or "_".
    Yes, this is more restrictive than JavaScript's requirements for function names.
  <li>The time axis on graphs now works well for longer time ranges (80 - 10000 years)
    and shorter time ranges (0.003 - 180 seconds).
  <li>ERDDAP is now more forgiving when parsing variations of ISO-8601-format time data.
  <li>There were many other small changes and bug fixes.
  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li><b>You MUST update to the latest version to be secure.</b>
    <br>ERDDAP underwent a security audit. There were some bugs and weaknesses.
    Version 1.44 includes several important security bug fixes and 
    several changes to increase security and accessibility (e.g., for vision impaired users).      
    Version 1.44 has passed the follow-up security audit.
    Thanks to all the good people at USGS and Acunetix who made this possible.
    (Shouldn't NOAA be doing this?)

  <li>The new 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromWFSFiles"
    >EDDTableFromWFSFiles</a> makes a local copy of all of the data from an ArcGIS MapServer WFS server
    and so the data can then be re-served quickly to ERDDAP users.
    Thanks to Christy Caudill.

  <li>The new
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromEDDGrid"
    >EDDTableFromEDDGrid</a> lets you create an EDDTable dataset from an EDDGrid dataset.
    Some common reasons for doing this are:
    <ul>
    <li>This allows the dataset to be queried with OPeNDAP selection constraints 
      (which a user may have requested).
    <li>The dataset is inherently a tabular dataset.
    </ul>
    Thanks to OOICI, Jim Potemra, Roy Mendelssohn.

  <li>The variable name "depth" is now a special alternative to "altitude". 
    The units must be some variant of "meters".  The data values must be positive=down.
    ERDDAP is now fully aware of the meaning of "depth" and supports
    it wherever altitude is supported (e.g., as a component of a CF DSG cdm_data_type=profile dataset).
    A dataset must not have both "depth" and "altitude" variables.

  <li>In your datasets.xml, please remove any uses of
    <tt>&lt;att name="cdm_altitude_proxy"&gt;depth&lt;/att&gt;</tt>
    since <tt>depth</tt> is now a special alternative to <tt>altitude</tt> and
    so doesn't need to be specially identified.

  <li>In your datasets.xml, please remove any uses of
    <tt>&lt;altitudeMetersPerSourceUnit&gt;</tt>, except for EDDTableFromSOS.
    <br>When the value is 1, just delete it.  
    <br>When the value is -1, consider changing the variable name to <tt>depth</tt>.  
    <br>For other values, add to &lt;addAttributes&gt;, for example,:
    <br><tt>  &lt;att name="scale_factor" type="float"&gt;-1&lt;/att&gt; </tt>

  <li>All datasets now support
    <ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;defaultDataQuery&gt;</tt> which is used if .html is requested with no query.
      <ul>
      <li>You will probably rarely need to use this.
      <li>For griddap datasets, a common use of this is to specify a different default 
        depth or altitude dimension value (e.g., [0] instead of [last]).
        <br>In any case, you should always list all of the variables, 
          always use the same dimension values for all variables,
          and almost always use [0], [last], or [0:last] for the dimension values.
        <br>For example:        <br><tt>&lt;defaultDataQuery&gt;u[last][0][0:last][0:last],v[last][0][0:last][0:last]&lt;/defaultDataQuery&gt;</tt>
      <li>For tabledap datasets, the most common use of this is to specify a different default 
        time range (relative to <tt>now</tt>, e.g., <tt>&amp;time&gt;=now-1day</tt>).
        <br>Remember that requesting no data variables is the same as specifying all data variables, 
          so usually you can just specify the new time constraint.
        <br>For example:        
        <br><tt>&lt;defaultDataQuery&gt;&amp;amp;time&amp;gt;=now-1day&lt;/defaultDataQuery&gt;</tt>
      </ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;defaultGraphQuery&gt;</tt> which is used if .graph is requested with no query.
      <ul>
      <li>You will probably rarely need to use this.
      <li>For gridddap datasets, the most common use of this is to specify a different default 
        depth or altitude dimension value (e.g., [0] instead of [last]) and/or to specify that a specific
        variable be graphed.
        <br>In any case, you will almost always use [0], [last], or [0:last] for the dimension values.
        <br>For example:                <br><tt>&lt;defaultGraphQuery&gt;temp[last][0][0:last][0:last]&amp;amp;.draw=surface&amp;amp;.vars=longitude|latitude|temp&lt;/defaultGraphQuery&gt;</tt>
      <li>For tabledap datasets, the most common uses of this are to specify 
        different variables to be graphed, a different default time range 
        (relative to <tt>now</tt>, e.g., <tt>&amp;time&gt;=now-1day</tt>) 
        and/or different default graphics settings (e.g., marker type).
        <br>For example:        
        <br><tt>&lt;defaultGraphQuery&gt;longitude,latitude,seaTemperature&amp;amp;time&gt;=now-1day&amp;amp;.marker=1|5&lt;/defaultGraphQuery&gt;</tt>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    Remember that you need to XML-encode or percent-encode (either one, but not both) 
    the default queries since they are in an XML document.
    For example, &amp; becomes &amp;amp; , &lt; becomes &amp;lt; , and &gt; becomes &amp;gt; .
    <br>And please check your work.  It is easy to make a mistake and not get what you want.
    <br>Thanks to Charles Carleton, Kevin O'Brien, Luke Campbell, and others.

  <li>EDDGridFromDap, EDDGridFromErddap, and EDDTableFromEDDGrid have a new system 
    to deal with datasets that change frequently (as often as roughly every 0.5 s). 
    Unlike ERDDAP's regular, proactive system for completely reloading each dataset, 
    this optional additional system is reactive (triggered by a user request)
    and incremental (just updating the information that needs to be updated).
    For example, if a request to an EDDGridFromDap dataset occurs more than
    the specified number of milliseconds since the last update,
    ERDDAP will see if there are any new values for the leftmost (usually "time") dimension
    and, if so, just download those new values before handling the user's request.
    This system is very good at keeping a rapidly changing dataset up-to-date 
    with minimal demands on the data source,
    but at the cost of slightly slowing down the processing of some user requests.
    See

    >&lt;updateEveryNMillis&gt;</a>
    <br>Thanks to Michael Barry and OOICI.

  <li>EDDGridFromNcFiles, EDDTableFromNcFiles, and EDDTableFromNcCFFiles now support 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#NcML">NcML .ncml</a> 
    source files in place of .nc files.
    Thanks to Jose B Rodriguez Rueda.

  <li>For EDDGridAggregateExistingDimension, ERDDAP supports a new 
    <tt>serverType="dodsindex"</tt> option for the <tt>serverType</tt> attribute 
    of the <tt>&lt;sourceUrls&gt;</tt> tag.
    This works with web pages that have lists of files within <tt>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</tt>
    and often beneath the page title "DODS Index of /...". An example is
    <a href="http://www.marine.csiro.au/dods/nph-dods/dods-data/bl/BRAN2.1/bodas/"
    >http://www.marine.csiro.au/dods/nph-dods/dods-data/bl/BRAN2.1/bodas/<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.

  <li>For EDDTableFromSOS now supports an optional tag
    <br><tt>&lt;sosServerType&gt;<i>serverType</i>&lt;/sosServerType&gt;</tt>
    <br>so you can specify the type of SOS server (so ERDDAP doesn't have to figure it out).
    Valid values of <tt>&lt;<i>serverType</i>&gt;</tt> are 
    <tt>IOOS_NDBC, IOOS_NOS, OOSTethys,</tt> and <tt>WHOI</tt> (a newly supported serverType).
    See <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromSOS"
    >EDDTableFromSOS</a>.
    Thanks to Derrick Snowden and Janet Fredericks.

  <li>All EDDGridFrom...Files, EDDTableFrom...Files, EDDGridCopy, and EDDTableCopy 
    now support an optional tag
    <br><tt>&lt;fileTableInMemory&gt;true&lt;/fileTableInMemory&gt;</tt>  (The default is <tt>false</tt>.)
    <br>which can tell ERDDAP to keep the fileTable (with information about each source data file) 
    in memory instead of just on the disk (the default).
    Keeping the fileTable in memory speeds up requests for data 
    (especially if there are &gt;1000 source data files), but uses more memory.
    If you set this to true for any dataset, keep an eye on the 
    <tt>Memory: currently using</tt> line at <i>yourDomain</i>/erddap/status.html 
    to ensure that ERDDAP still has plenty of free memory.
    Thanks to Fredrik Stray.

  <li>EDDTableFromASCIIFiles now supports <tt>&lt;charset&gt;</tt>.
    The two most common charsets (case sensitive!) are ISO-8859-1 (the default) and UTF-8.  

  <li>Recommended: in setup.xml, within <tt>&lt;startHeadHtml&gt;</tt>, please change 
    <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> into 
    <br><tt>&lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;</tt> 
    (or a different 
    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">language code<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
    if you have translated messages.xml).

  <li>setup.xml has new optional tags to disable parts of ERDDAP:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;convertersActive&gt;false&lt;/convertersActive&gt;   &lt;!-- the default is true --&gt;</tt>
    <li><tt>&lt;slideSorterActive&gt;false&lt;/slideSorterActive&gt; &lt;!-- the default is true --&gt;</tt>
    <li><tt>&lt;wmsActive&gt;false&lt;/wmsActive&gt;                 &lt;!-- the default is true --&gt;</tt>
    </ul>
    In general, we recommend against setting any of these to false.

  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml now writes results to <i>bigParentDirectory</i>/logs/generateDatasetsXmlLog.txt,
    not log.txt.
    Thanks to Kristian Sebastian Blalid.

  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml now makes a good suggestion for the <tt>&lt;reloadEveryNMinutes&gt;</tt>.
    Thanks to the NOAA UAF project.

  <li>Many small improvements to GenerateDatasetsXml.
    Thanks to the NOAA UAF project.

<h2><a name="changes1.38">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.38 (released 2012-04-21)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>ISO 19115 and FGDC - ERDDAP can automatically generate
    ISO 19115 and FGDC XML metadata files for each dataset. 
    Links to the files are visible on every list of datasets
    (e.g., from Full Text Search) and also in Web Accessible Folders (WAF)
    (see the <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/metadata/fgdc/xml/">FGDC WAF</a> and
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/metadata/iso19115/xml/">ISO 19115 WAF</a>).
    Thanks to Ted Habermann, Dave Neufeld, and many others.

  <li>Full Text Searches for Datasets now support <tt>-<i>excludedWord</i></tt>
      and <tt>-"<i>excluded phrase</i>"</tt> .
      Thanks to Rich Signell.

  <li>Searches for datasets now return results a page at a time. The
    default uses the parameter string: <tt>page=1&amp;itemsPerPage=1000</tt>,
    but you can change the values in the URL of your request.
    Thanks to Steve Hankin and the UAF project.

  <li>OpenSearch - ERDDAP now supports the
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/opensearch1.1/index.html">OpenSearch 1.1</a>
    standard for searching for datasets. Among other things, this allows
    catalog aggregation websites to do distributed searches
    (passing a search request to each catalog that it knows about).

  <li>Comma Separated Value (CSV) Files - 
    ERDDAP now generates CSV files with just a comma between values
    (which Excel prefers), instead of comma+space.
    Thanks to Jeff deLaBeaujardiere.

  <li>Million Datasets - Several changes were made to support ERDDAPs having
    a huge number of datasets, perhaps even a million.
    Thanks to Steve Hankin and the UAF project.

  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>

  <li><a name="quickRestart">A</a> quick restart system allows ERDDAP to restart much faster.
    <br><b>Please add this to your setup.xml file</b> 
    right after <tt>&lt;/datasetsRegex&gt;</tt>:<pre>
      &lt;!-- If true, when you start up ERDDAP, some types of datasets (e.g., 
      EDDGridFromDap) will used cached information (.dds, .das, etc.) to reload
      very quickly, without contacting the remote server.  The dataset's age 
      will be based on when the dataset was reloaded last.  Normally this 
      should be true (the default), but set it to false if you want to bypass 
      the cached information.
      &lt;quickRestart&gt;true&lt;/quickRestart&gt;</pre>

  <li>Full text searches for datasets can now be done with the Lucene search 
    engine (although we recommend the original search engine if you have fewer
    than 10,000 datasets) or the original search system.
    <br><b>Please add this to your setup.xml file</b>
    right after <tt>&lt;/displayDiagnosticInfo&gt;</tt>:<pre>
      &lt;!-- ERDDAP lets you choose between two search engines for full text searches:
      * original (the default) - is the best choice if your ERDDAP has fewer 
        than about 10,000 datasets.  It is very robust and trouble free. 
      * lucene - is the best choice for more than about 10,000 datasets.
        The advantages are that with any number of datasets it works fast 
        and uses very little memory.
        But there are many things that might go wrong with individual 
        queries and with the whole system. 
        And although its behaviour (the datasets it finds and the order that
        it ranks them) is almost identical to the original search engine,
        it has a few quirky, subtle, small differences.
      --&gt;
      &lt;searchEngine&gt;original&lt;/searchEngine&gt;</pre>

  <li>In setup.xml, you can/should now add two new categories to the comma-separated list 
    of <tt>&lt;categoryAttributes&gt;</tt>:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>global:keywords</tt> (add it right after <tt>global:institution</tt>) -- 
      a new special case that parses a 
      comma-separated list of keywords from the global <tt>keywords</tt> 
      attribute to make a separate entry for each keyword.
    <li><tt>variableName</tt> (add it at the end) -- 
      a new special case that categorizes each of the dataVariable destinationNames.
    </ul>

  <li>In setup.xml, you can (but why?) tell ERDDAP not to offer FGDC and/or ISO 19115 metadata
    for any dataset by including<tt>
    <br>&lt;fgdcActive&gt;false&lt;/fgdcActive&gt;
    <br>&lt;iso19115Active&gt;false&lt;/iso19115Active&gt;</tt>
    <br>The default values for these settings is <tt>true</tt>.

  <li>In datasets.xml, please consider improving the metadata for your 
    datasets. ERDDAP now automatically generates
    ISO 19115 and FGDC XML metadata files for each dataset based on the
    dataset's metadata. 
    <br>So, <b>good dataset metadata leads to good ERDDAP-generated 
    ISO 19115 and FGDC metadata.</b>
    <br><b>See the new documentation for the many new RECOMMENDED
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#globalAttributes">Global Attributes</a>.</b>  

  <li>In datasets.xml, if you want to tell ERDDAP to use a pre-made 
    FGDC and/or ISO 19115 file
    that is somewhere on the server's file system
    instead of having ERDDAP generate these files, use:<tt>
    <br>&lt;fgdcFile&gt;<i>fullFileName</i>&lt;/fgdcFile&gt;
    <br>&lt;iso19115File&gt;<i>fullFileName</i>&lt;/iso19115File&gt;</tt>
    <br>If <tt><i>fullFileName</i></tt>="" or the file isn't found, 
      the dataset will have no FGDC and/or ISO 19115 metadata.
      So this is also useful if you want to suppress the FGDC and/or ISO 19115 metadata
      for a specific dataset.

  <li>In datasets.xml, for all EDDGridSideBySide and EDDGridAggregateExistingDimension
    datasets, make certain that child datasets have different datasetIDs
    than their parent datasets and than the other children.
    (For example, you could follow George Foreman's simple but effective 
    system for naming his children.) 
    If any names in a family are exactly the same, the dataset will fail to load
    (with the error message that the values of the aggregated axis are not in sorted order).

  <li>In datasets.xml, there were some changes to the list of valid ioos_category
    metadata values:
    <ul>
    <li>"pCO2" was changed to "CO2". 
    <li>"Physical Oceanography" was added.
    <li>"Soils" was added.
    </ul>
 
  <li>In datasets.xml, ERDDAP no longer allows '.' in a datasetID.  
    It was allowed but discouraged. (Sorry)

  <li>In datasets.xml, the setup for EDDTableFromThreddsFiles and EDDTableFromHyraxFiles
    has changed slightly because both classes were just rewritten to be more efficient
    (both classes now always make a local copy of all of the remote data files).
    See the documentation for setting up these classes:
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromHyraxFiles">EDDTableFromHyraxFiles</a> and
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromThreddsFiles">EDDTableFromThreddsFiles</a>.
    In particular, see the revised comments about <tt>&lt;fileDir&gt;</tt> (now irrelevant)
    and <tt>&lt;sourceUrl&gt;</tt> (now essential).
    Also, you should never wrap this class in EDDTableCopy for efficiency.

  <li>In datasets.xml, if you use EDDTableFromDatabase with an Oracle database,
    you should include a connectionProperty such as
    <br><tt>&lt;connectionProperty name="defaultRowPrefetch"&gt;4096&lt;/connectionProperty&gt;</tt>
    <br>to specify how many rows of data to fetch at one time 
    because the default is 10, which is horribly inefficient.
    See the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/java.920/a96654/basic.htm">Oracle
    documentation<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
    MySql and PostgreSQL seem to have better defaults for this setting.
    Thanks to Kevin O'Brien.

  <li>If you use EDDTableFromDatabase, see the improved 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromDatabase">"Speed" documentation</a> 
    for additional suggestions to improve performance.
    Thanks to Kevin O'Brien.

  <li>In datasets.xml, for all EDDTable... datasets, in the <tt>Conventions</tt> and
    <tt>Metadata_Conventions</tt> global attributes, please refer to 
    CF-1.6 (not CF-1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5), 
    since CF-1.6 is the first version to include the changes related to the
    Discrete Sampling Geometry.

  <li>Programmers that are compiling the ERDDAP code need to add <tt>lib/lucene-core.jar</tt>
    to the list of jar files in their javac and java command line paths.

  <li>ERDDAP has a 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/convert/keywords.html">new service</a>
    to convert a CF Standard Name to/from a GCMD Science Keyword.
    You may find this useful when generating global <tt>keywords</tt>
    metadata for the datasets in your ERDDAP.

  <li>Dealing with Bots - Please read this advice to
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#robots">prevent
    bots from crawling your ERDDAP in a stupid way</a>.

  <li>Translation - The text on ERDDAP's web pages is now mostly
    in messages.xml and so suitable for translation to different languages
    (e.g., German, French).
    The messages now often use MessageFormat for formatting, also to aid
    in making translations.  If you are interested in doing a translation,
    please email bob dot simons at noaa dot gov .

  <li>Sample datasets.xml - There were several small but significant errors in the
    sample datasets.xml. If you use those datasets, please get the newer versions
    from the new sample datasets.xml in the new
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/erddapContent.zip">erddapContent.zip</a>.
    Thanks to James Wilkinson.  

  <li>Git - I will try hard to make ERDDAP a GitHub project ASAP after 
    this release.  
  </ul>


<li><b>Small changes/Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>A new palette, OceanDepth, is useful for depth values (positive is down),
    e.g., 0 (shallow) to 8000 (deep).

  <li>The .kml output from tabledap uses a better marker icon (it isn't fuzzy).
    And hovering over a marker now makes it bigger.
  
  <li>EDDTableFromFiles - 
    In the last upgrade, the new netcdf-java library had tighter restrictions 
    for variable names in .nc files. That caused problems for EDDTableFromFiles
    if a variable's sourceName had certain punctuation characters.
    EDDTableFromFiles is now modified to avoid that problem.
    Thanks to Thomas Holcomb.

  <li>The .subset page now supports 0/10/100/1000/10000/100000 instead of a check box
    for <tt>Related Data</tt>.  The tooltip warns that 100000 may cause your
    browser to crash.
    Thanks to Annette DesRochers, Richard (Abe) Coughlin, and the IOOS Biological Project.

  <li>.../erddap/info/<i>datasetID</i>/index.html web pages now show urls and email 
    addresses as clickable links.
    Thanks to Richard (Abe) Coughlin and the IOOS Biological Project.

  <li>Bug fix: In tabledap, for datasets with altitudeMetersPerSourceUnit &lt; 0,
    queries with altitude constraints were handled incorrectly.
    Thanks to Kyle Wilcox.

  <li>Bug fix: EDDGridAggregateFromExistingDimension now supports more diverse TDS URLs.

       <li>If your datasets.xml doesn't have a dataset with 
           <tt>datasetID="erdGlobecBottle"</tt>, add<tt>
         <br>&lt;dataset type="EDDTableFromErddap" datasetID="erdGlobecBottle" active="true"&gt;
         <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;sourceUrl&gt;http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/erdGlobecBottle&lt;/sourceUrl&gt;
         <br>&lt;/dataset&gt;</tt>
       <li>In your setup.xml, replace all of the tags from <tt>&lt;EDDTableIdExample&gt;</tt> through
         <br><tt>&lt;EDDTableMatlabPlotExample&gt;</tt> with <pre>
&lt;!-- Tabledap Examples
This group of settings is used to make examples for the tabledap documentation 
that appears at [baseUrl]/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html and elsewhere.
If you include the erdGlobecBottle dataset in your datasets.xml (recommended), 
you don't need to change these.
If you don't, you MUST change these before you make your ERDDAP public; 
otherwise, none of the examples will work!
The new settings should be very similar to the defaults.
If your ERDDAP won't serve any tabular datasets, use "NOT_APPLICABLE" for all of the enties.
In .xml files like this, ampersand, lessThan, and greaterThan have to be 
HTML encoded as "&amp;amp;", "&amp;lt;", "&amp;gt;".
--&gt;
&lt;!-- This is the datasetID for an EDDTable dataset that is served by your ERDDAP.
     This dataset is used as the basis for all of the EDDGrid examples below. 
     Ideally, it is a dataset that has longitude, latitude, and time variables (among others). 
     ('time' allows for making a time series graph. 'latitude' and 'longitude' allow for making a map.)
     The dataset can have longitude values -180 to 180, or 0 to 360. --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableIdExample&gt;erdGlobecBottle&lt;/EDDTableIdExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a comma-separated list of variables from the dataset.
     It is useful if it is "longitude,latitude,time," plus a data variable name. --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableVariablesExample&gt;longitude,latitude,time,bottle_posn,temperature1&lt;/EDDTableVariablesExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is the constraints example which is appended to EDDTableVariablesExample. --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableConstraintsExample&gt;&amp;amp;time&amp;gt;=2002-08-17T00:00:00Z&amp;amp;time&amp;lt;=2002-08-19T20:18:00Z&lt;/EDDTableConstraintsExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is an example data query using an ISO-formatted time. 
     You could generate your example via your dataset's Data Access Form in ERDDAP.  --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableDataTimeExample&gt;longitude,latitude,time,bottle_posn,temperature1&amp;amp;time&amp;gt;=2002-08-17T00:00:00Z&amp;amp;time&amp;lt;=2002-08-19T20:18:00Z&lt;/EDDTableDataTimeExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is an equivalent example data query, but which specifies time as seconds-since-1970-01-01. 
     If you need to convert a date/time to "seconds since 1970-01-01", use
     http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/convert/time.html --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableDataValueExample&gt;longitude,latitude,time,bottle_posn,temperature1&amp;amp;time&amp;gt;=1029542400&amp;amp;time&amp;lt;=1029788280&lt;/EDDTableDataValueExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is an example query which generates a graph. 
     You could generate your example via your dataset's Make A Graph form in ERDDAP.  --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableGraphExample&gt;bottle_posn,temperature1&amp;amp;time=2002-08-19T10:06:00Z&amp;amp;.draw=lines&lt;/EDDTableGraphExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is an example query which generates a map. 
     In the default mapExample, temperature1, time, bottle_posn are useful 
     because they appear in GoogleEarth with the .kml example 
     and are ignored by the other image file types. --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableMapExample&gt;longitude,latitude,temperature1,time,bottle_posn&amp;amp;time&amp;gt;=2002-08-13T00:00:00Z&amp;amp;time&amp;lt;=2002-08-20T00:00:00Z&amp;amp;bottle_posn=1&amp;amp;.draw=markers&amp;amp;.marker=5|5&lt;/EDDTableMapExample&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a Matlab example which uses data from the EDDTableGraphExample.
     Note the Matlab notation datasetName.variableName.  --&gt;
&lt;EDDTableMatlabPlotExample&gt;plot(erdGlobecBottle.bottle_posn, erdGlobecBottle.temperature1)&lt;/EDDTableMatlabPlotExample&gt;
         </pre>
       </ul>
     </ul>
  <li>For datasets where the type is a subclass of EDDTableFromFiles,
    you can now make data from metadata.
    <br>Specifically, you can now make a variable from the values of an attribute 
    of one of the original variables.
    <br>For example, in datasets.xml, within a <tt>&lt;dataVariable&gt;</tt> tag, if you use 
    <br><tt>&lt;sourceName&gt;variable:cruise:PI&lt;/sourceName&gt;</tt>
    <br>ERDDAP will make a variable with the values of the PI attribute of the cruise variable.
    <br>Thanks to WOD.

<ul>
<li><b>Changes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Bug fix: Fixed memory leak that occurred on some 64-bit Java installations. 
  <li>Bug fix: ERDDAP now correctly sets these global attributes when
     the latitude dimension's values ranged from high to low:
     <tt>geospatial_lat_min, geospatial_lat_max, Southernmost_Northing, Northernmost_Northing</tt>.
     <p>Note that <tt>actual_range</tt> is unchanged: it may have low,high values or high,low values,
     since it is intended to indicate the range and the order of storage.    
  <li>Small changes.
  <li>ERDDAP administrators don't need to make any changes to their setup.xml or datasets.xml.
  </ul>
</ul>


<!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
<h2><a name="changes1.32">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.32 (released 2011-05-20)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Changes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Support for the newly ratified, CF Discrete Sampling Geometries 
    (which unfortunately is not yet available online),
    which replaces the proposed CF Point Observation Conventions.
    <br>ERDDAP users will see that cdm_feature_type=Station is replaced by TimeSeries
      and there are small changes to the files created for the .ncCF file type
      (flat_dimension is now called sample_dimension).
    <br>ERDDAP administrators will need to make these changes in datasets.xml:
      <ul>
      <li>cdm_data_type=Station should be changed to cdm_data_type=TimeSeries.
      <li>cdm_data_type=StationProfile should be changed to cdm_data_type=TimeSeriesProfile.
      <li>cdm_station_variables should be changed to cdm_timeseries_variables.
      <li>cf_role=station_id should be changed to cf_role=timeseries_id.
    </ul>
  <li>New ioos_category options: "Colored Dissolved Organic Matter", "pCO2", "Stream Flow", 
    "Total Suspended Matter".
  <li>Possible solution to a possible memory leak on 64-bit Java. [It didn't work.]
  <li>Small changes.
  </ul>
</ul>

<!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
<h2><a name="changes1.30">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.30 (released 2011-04-29)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Support for 64-bit Java.  When used with a 64-bit Java, ERDDAP can now use
    much more heap memory and handle many more simultaneous requests.
  <li>Support for .nc file requests up to 2GB (even without 64-bit Java) via better use of
    ERDDAP's handling of data in chunks.
  <li>Many 2X speed improvements in the code and 2X speed ups from Java 1.6 make ERDDAP 2X to 4X
    faster than before.
  <li>Memory saving improvements significantly lower ERDDAP's base memory usage.
  <li>For tabular datasets, ERDDAP is now fully aware of a dataset's cdm_data_type, and
    how the data maps to the CDM type. See the 
      <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries">CF Discrete Sampling Geometries specification<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
      Perhaps someday soon, that Word file will be converted to .html and replace 
      the current "OBSOLETE" information on that web page. Thanks to the NOAA UAF project.
  <li>For most EDDTable datasets, a new output file type option, .ncCF, creates 
    Contiguous Ragged Array .nc files which conform to the latest version of the 
      <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries">CF Discrete Sampling Geometries conventions<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
    These files are structured to reflect the CDM data type of the dataset.
    Since the proposed conventions just changed, as of this writing, the netcdf-java 
    library does not yet support reading the file formats created by ERDDAP
    and interpreting them as CDM data files. It probably will soon.
    Thanks to the NOAA UAF project.
  <li>The <tt>View : Distinct Data</tt> option on the .subset web page is now a drop-down list 
    that lets users specify the maximum number of rows of distinct data to be viewed
    (default = 1000). This change, and others, allow ERDDAP to work with datasets that have 
    very large numbers
    of rows of distinct data.  (The number of unique values for any single variable is 
    still an issue, but it can be pretty high (20,000?) before the .subset and other web pages
    load really slowly.) 
    Thanks to the NOAA UAF project.
  <li>.subset web pages have a new option: <tt>View Distinct Data Counts</tt>.  
    Thanks to the GTOPP project.
  <li>To aid users, the distinct values (e.g., station names) are now shown on the Make-A-Graph 
    and Data Access Forms.
    Thanks to the NOAA UAF project.
  <li>.transparentPng requests now support all types of graphs and data representations. 
    It draws just the data -- no axes, legends, landmask, or anything else.
    This makes it possible to make images as layers of transparentPngs.
    If <tt>&amp;.size=<i>width</i>|<i>height</i></tt> 
    is specified in the query (recommended), it is honored.
    The default is 360x360 pixels. The only exception is EDDGrid <tt>&amp;.draw=surface</tt>, 
      where the 
    default (as before) is an image with ~1/pixel per datam (up to 3000 x and y pixels).
    Thanks to Fred Hochstaedter.
  <li>The WMS web pages now show the color bar for the dataset's variable(s).
    Thanks to Emilio Mayorga and others.
  </ul>
<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>This release involves a lot of changes. They are all important. Please be patient
    and work through all of the changes listed below.
  <li>This version is being pushed out earlier than intended to deal with some Java security bugs.
    Unfortunately, several features/fixes intended for this ERDDAP version are not in this version.
    Sorry. Hopefully, the next version will be relatively soon (and much easier to upgrade to).

  <li>To avoid several security bugs in Java 6 update 23 and below, 
      <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">download<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
      and install the latest version 
    of Java (Java 6 update 24 or higher). 
    If you have a 64-bit operating system, please get a 64-bit version of Java.

  <li>If you are using Tomcat 5, you MUST upgrade to Tomcat 6 or 7 (preferred).
    If you are using Tomcat 6, consider upgrading to Tomcat version 7.

  <li>Please follow all of the instructions for
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#initialSetup">setting up a new ERDDAP</a>, but where relevant,
    you will be copying files from your old installation to the new installation,
    notably the [tomcat]/content/erddap directory and files. 
    As part of that, note the 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#tomcat">new Tomcat setup recommendations</a>.

  <li>The default erddap.css is now included in the erddap.war file.
    <ul>
    <li>To use the default erddap.css, <b>delete</b> your old
      [tomcat]/content/erddap/images/erddap.css .
    <li>If you modified [tomcat]/content/erddap/images/erddap.css, and want to keep using it: 
      just leave it in place and replace the &lt;input&gt; section with:<tt>
      <br>/* Small input items let more be shown on one screen 
      <br>(esp. Chrome and Safari). Google Chrome and Safari have
      <br>default margin 2px, while others are 0.  This sets all to 0.
      <br>.skinny is used e.g., for the buttons above the image on
      <br>a Make A Graph page. */
      <br>input[type=button], input[type=submit], button {
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:0px; padding:0px 3px; }
      <br>input[type=checkbox], input[type=password],
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;input[type=text], select, textarea {
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:0px; padding:0px; }
      <br>input[type=radio] {margin:0px 2px; padding:0px; } 
      <br>input.skinny {padding:0px 1px; } </tt>
    </ul>

  <li>In your [tomcat]/content/erddap/setup.xml:
    <ul>
    <li>Replace the comments and tags related to <tt>&lt;partialRequestMaxBytes&gt;</tt> and
        <tt>&lt;partialRequestMaxCells&gt;</tt> with <tt>
      <br>&lt;!-- When possible (and it isn't always possible), 
      <br>ERDDAP breaks source data requests into chunks to 
      <br>conserve memory. See the description of these tags in 
      <br>messages.xml. You can override the default chunk sizes 
      <br>here with 
      <br>For grids: 
      <br>&nbsp;&lt;partialRequestMaxBytes&gt;100000000&lt;/partialRequestMaxBytes&gt;
      <br>For tables: 
      <br>&nbsp;&lt;partialRequestMaxCells&gt;100000&lt;/partialRequestMaxCells&gt;
      <br>--&gt;</tt>
    <li>Replace the comments related to <tt>&lt;categoryAttributes&gt;</tt> and consider 
      modifying the tag's value:<tt>       
      <br>&lt;!-- This is the comma-separated list (recommended:
      <br>in alphabetical order) of the global attribute and
      <br>variable attribute names which will be used to 
      <br>categorize the datasets and shown to clients at urls
      <br>like .../erddap/categorize/ioos_category/index.html 
      <br>(ioos_category is unusual, but is used at ERD).
      <br>If an attribute is a global attribute, identify it by
      <br>prefixing it with "global:".
      <br>--&gt;
      <br>&lt;categoryAttributes&gt;global:institution, ioos_category,
      <br>long_name, standard_name&lt;/categoryAttributes&gt;</tt>
      <br>&nbsp;
      <br>Individual <tt>&lt;categoryAttributes&gt;</tt> that are global attributes now MUST be 
      identified via the prefix <tt>global:</tt> (e.g., <tt>global:institution</tt>). 
      Others attributes 
      are assumed to be variable attributes (e.g., <tt>standard_name</tt>). 
      Also, institution values (the only ones) were left in original case. 
      Now all category values are converted to lower case.
    </ul>

  <li>In your [tomcat]/content/erddap/datasets.xml:
    <ul>
    <li>Big change: ERDDAP has new requirements related to a tabular dataset's cdm_data_type.
      Notably, each dataset MUST have the correct metadata and variables related to the
      cdm_data_type. If not, the dataset won't load and will throw an error.
      See the documentation for 
        <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#cdm_data_type">cdm_data_type</a>.
    <li>FYI: There is a new dataset type: EDDTableFromAsciiServiceNOS.
    <li>FYI: There are three newly allowed ioos_category options: Hydrology, Quality (e.g., for 
      quality flags), and Statistics (e.g., mean).
    <li>For EDDTableFrom...Files datasets, remove any <tt>&lt;nDimensions&gt;</tt> tags.
      They are no longer needed or used.
    <li>For variables with destinationName=altitude, ERDDAP no longer forces the long_name to be
      Altitude. Please go through your datasets.xml and repeatedly 
      search for <tt>&lt;destinationName&gt;altitude</tt>
      and add to that variable's <tt>&lt;addAttributes&gt;</tt>:
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&lt;att name="long_name"&gt;Altitude&lt;/att&gt;</tt>
      <br>(or a slightly different long_name in special cases).
    <li>Optional: All EDDTableFromFiles subclasses support variable 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#globalSourceNames">sourceName=global:...</a> 
      to convert global metadata from each file into a data variable. Thanks to Lynn DeWitt.
    </ul>

  <li>EDDTableFromDatabase users - ERDDAP comes with a new JDBC 4 driver for Postgres.
    For other databases, check the web for the lastest JDBC .jar file for your database.
    Since ERDDAP now uses Java 1.6+, JDBC 4 (not 3) is probably recommended.    

  <li>FYI
    <ul>
    <li>EDDGridFrom...Files and EDDTableFrom...Files datasets now store the fileTable information 
      in 
      <br>[bigParentDirectory]/datasetInfo/[datasetID]/*.nc files.
      <br>Also, EDDTable datasets now store the subset information in 
      <br>[bigParentDirectory]/datasetInfo/[datasetID]/*.nc files.
      These files used to be 
      <br>[bigParentDirectory]/datasetInfo/[datasetID].*.json files.
      <br>The old files will be deleted automatically when ERDDAP starts up.
      Or, you can delete all files (but leave the empty subdirectories) in [bigParentDirectory]/datasetInfo/.
    <li>I worked on a new EDDTableFromNcCFFiles which would read data from local and remote
      files using the proposed, new CF Point Observation Conventions. But it isn't in this release.
      There are problems in the netcdf-java libraries related to some methods for reading these
      files. And there were some very recent changes to the proposed CF Point Observation 
      Conventions. When the netcdf-java library is fixed and updated to the latest proposal, 
      I will resume work on this.
    <li>Running ERDDAP on Windows may have problems: notably, you may see in the 
      [bigParentDirectory/logs/log.txt file that ERDDAP is sometimes unable to delete 
      and/or rename files quickly. This is due to antivirus software (e.g., from MacAfee
      and Norton) which is checking the files for viruses. If you run into this problem (which
      can be seen by error messages in the log.txt file like "Unable to delete ..."), changing the
      antivirus software's settings may partially alleviate the problem.
      <br>If the ERDDAP in Windows is just a test running on your desktop, 
      this is just an annoyance.
      <br>If the ERDDAP in Windows is your public ERDDAP, consider switching to a Linux server.
    </ul>

  <li>Slow First Startup - The first time you run ERDDAP after upgrading,
    ERDDAP may be slow to load the datasets. The way ERDDAP stores information about
    aggregated files has changed, so ERDDAP will need to re-read some info from all of those
    files. That will take time.

  <li>Errors on Startup - Given the changes related to cdm_data_type, it is likely that some
    of your datasets won't load and will throw errors.  Carefully read the Daily Report 
    email that ERDDAP sends you when ERDDAP is finished starting up.
    It will have a list of datasets that didn't load (at the top) and the reason they didn't
    load (near the bottom).  

  <li>If you get stuck or have other questions, email the details to me: bob.simons at noaa.gov.

  <li>Programmers - If you write Java programs that run ERDDAP code, you need to
    change some of the command line parameter references:
    <ul>
    <li>Change joda-time-1.6.2.jar to joda-time.jar
    <li>Change the Postgres JDBC .jar reference to postgresql.jdbc.jar
    </ul>
  </ul>

<li><b>Small Changes and Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Improved connection handling to avoid hung threads.
  <li>Improved concurrency practices to handle nearly simultaneous identical requests more efficiently.
  <li>ERDDAP now uses netcdfAll-4.2.jar (renamed to netcdfAll-latest.jar).
    This switch necessitated several internal changes and causes a few small external changes,
    e.g., changes to how grib files are read and tiny changes to the .ncHeader output.
  <li>New feature: [erddap]/convert/fipscounty.html converts FIPS county codes to/from county names.
  <li>On maps, state boundaries are now dark violet, so they stand out a better
    on all background colors.
  <li>Tabular .kml output again uses a circular icon to mark points (not the airplane icon Google 
    recently switched to).
  <li>The erdCalcofi datasets were re-arranged and are now served from local files (faster).
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml fromThreddsCatalog now creates a results file:
    <br>[tomcat]/webapps/erddap/WEB-INF/temp/EDDGridFromThreddsCatalog.xml .
    Thanks to Kevin O'Brien.
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml fromThreddsCatalog now tries to remove unnecessary port numbers 
    from the source URLs (e.g., :8080 and :8081 can sometimes be removed).
    Thanks to NOAA central's security team.
  <li>For .subset web pages, the Map of Distinct Data now has a variable lat lon range.
  <li>Several lists in ERDDAP (e.g., the table which shows all of the datasets) were sorted
    so that A..Z sorted before a..z.  Now they sort in a case-insensitive way.
  <li>Small changes to the .subset web pages, including: units are now indicated.
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml and DasDds no longer throw an exception if unable to put the results
    on the system clipboard or displayInBrowser.  Thanks to Eric Bridger and Greg Williams.
  <li>Bug fix: When datasets are loaded, ERDDAP now removes or adjusts the geospatial 
    global attributes. Thanks to Charles Carleton.
  <li>Bug fix: String2.getClassPath() now properly percent-decodes the classPath
    (notably, on Windows, spaces in the file name appeared as %20).
    This affected ERDDAP EDStatic calling SSR.getContextDirectory() and finding content/erddap.
    Thanks to Abe Coughlin.
  <li>Bug fix: in EDDTableFromFiles related to getDataForDapQuery handling of distinct() requests.
    Thanks to Eric Bridger.
  <li>Bug fix: tabledap requests didn't properly handle altitude constraints when the dataset's
    altitudeMetersPerSourceUnit was -1.  Thanks to Eric Bridger.
  <li>Bug fix: EDDTableFrom...Files datasets now correctly handle requests which include
    =NaN and !=NaN.

<h2><a name="changes1.24">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.24 (released 2010-08-06)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Features:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/index.html">Subset web pages</a> 
    use faceted search to select subsets of tabular datasets. Thanks to POST.
  <li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/search/advanced.html">Advanced Search</a>
    combines all of the other search options and adds longitude, latitude, 
    and time bounding boxes. Thanks to Ellyn Montgomery. (Sorry for the delay.)
  <li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/convert/time.html">Convert Time</a> 
    web page and service let you convert numeric times to/from ISO string times.
  <li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/convert/units.html">Convert Units</a>
    web page and service let you convert UDUNITS to/from UCUM units.
    Thanks to NOAA IOOS SOS.
  <li>If a tabledap request includes <tt>&amp;units("UCUM")</tt>, the units names will be converted
    from original names (usually UDUNITS) to 
      <a href="http://aurora.regenstrief.org/~ucum/ucum.html">UCUM<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> 
    units names.
    This only affects units *names*, not data values. Thanks to NOAA IOOS SOS.
  <li>Improvements to Make A Graph web pages and graphs and maps:
    <ul>
    <li>If the graph is a map, there are new Make A Graph buttons to zoom in/out and a new option 
      to click to change the map's center point. Thanks to POST.
    <li>Filter settings added near the bottom.  Thanks to Greg Williams.
    <li>The built in coastline data files were updated to GSHHS v2.0. Thanks to POST.
    <li>Maps now include lakes and rivers. Thanks to POST.
      (Sorry, the Sacramento River Delta is missing because neither the coastline data nor the lake/river 
      dataset deals with it.)
    <li>The built in pscoast-derived nation/state files were updated. Thanks to POST.
    <li>Topography.cpt was modified slightly. (Sorry if this adversely affects you.) Thanks to POST.
    <li>In griddap's Make A Graph, if a user changes a variable, the form is automatically resubmitted so that
       the axisVariables' showStartAndStop always reflects the graph variables. Thanks to Joaquin Trinanes.
    <li>For png and pdf image URLs: 
      <ul>
      <li>New <tt>&amp;.land=<i>value</i></tt>, where <i>value</i> can be "under" (show topography) or
        "over" (just show bathymetry).
        If not specified, the default is set by 
          <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#drawLandMask">drawLandMask</a> in datasets.xml or setup.xml. 
        Thanks to POST.
      <li>New: lines in the legend that are too long are automatically broken into multiple lines. 
        Thanks to POST.
      </ul>
    <li>For png image URLs: 
      <ul>
      <li>New <tt>&amp;.legend=<i>value</i></tt>, where <i>value</i> can be "Bottom" (default), 
        "Off" or "Only".
        This lets you include the legend, exclude the legend, or get only the legend. 
        Thanks to Cara Wilson.
      <li>New <tt>&amp;.trim=<i>nPixels</i></tt> leaves a border of nPixels (e.g., 10) at the bottom of the image.
        It is applied after .legend=Off.   Thanks to Cara Wilson.
      <li>New <tt>&amp;.size=<i>width</i>|<i>height</i></tt> lets you specify the width and height for the 
        image, in pixels. 
       </ul>
     </ul>
  <li>New output file formats: 
    <ul>
    <li>.csvp and .tsvp - like .csv and .tsv, but with "(<i>units</i>)" appended to column names on first line.
    <li>.odvTxt - makes a .txt file that simplifies getting data into 
      <a href="http://odv.awi.de/">Ocean Data View (ODV)<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
    <li>.esriCsv - makes a .csv file suitable for import in ESRI's ArcGIS. (tabular datasets only)
    </ul>
    Thanks to Jan Mason, Jeff de La Beaujardiere, and NOAA IOOS SOS project.
  <li>GUI improvements to the 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/categorize/index.html">Categorize</a>
    web pages. 
    Also, the categorize values (other than institution) are now all lower case.  
    Non-lower case requests are accepted (redirected) for backwards compatibility.
    Thanks to Roy Mendelssohn.
  <li>Error messages are now even shorter and more oriented to users. Thanks to Greg Williams.
  <li>An internal change which greatly reduces ERDDAP's base memory usage.     
  <li>Many new features which are only relevant to the POST project.
  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Administrators Need to Know and Do:</b>
  There are lots of changes. Sorry. But each one brings some nice benefit.
  <ul>
  <li>Big changes to GenerateDatasetXml - it now often asks more questions (see the relevant
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#datasetTypes">datasetTypes</a> information) and now always generates essentially ready-to-use content for datasets.xml.
    You are still responsible for the setup, so you should still review the datasets.xml content before using it.
    A human putting effort into the project will always do better than a computer program.
    Thanks to the UAF project.
  <li>REQUIRED: In setup.xml, you must revise the WMS section. It should now include these tags
    (but feel free to change the values):
<pre>
&lt;!-- These default accessConstraints, fees, and keywords are used 
by the SOS, WCS, and WMS services.
They can be overridden by "accessConstraints", "fees", "keywords" 
attributes in a dataset's global metadata.
If a dataset that has an "accessibleTo" tag doesn't override 
"accessConstraints", then the default for "accessConstraints" is the
"accessRequiresAuthorization" value.  
--&gt;
&lt;accessConstraints&gt;NONE&lt;/accessConstraints&gt;
&lt;accessRequiresAuthorization&gt;only accessible to authorized
users&lt;/accessRequiresAuthorization&gt;
&lt;fees&gt;NONE&lt;/fees&gt;
&lt;keywords&gt;Earth science, oceans&lt;/keywords&gt; 

&lt;!-- This appears on the erddap/legal.html web page after the 
General Disclaimer. 
You can replace any of the [standardParts] with your own HTML. --&gt;
&lt;legal&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
[standardDisclaimerOfEndorsement]
[standardDisclaimerOfExternalLinks]
[standardPrivacyPolicy]
[standardDataLicenses]
]]>&lt;/legal&gt;

&lt;!-- Specify the default units standard (e.g., "UDUNITS" 
(the default) or "UCUM") that you (the ERDDAP admin) are using to 
specify units.  The value is case-sensitive.
This is used by ERDDAP's SOS server to determine if the units need to
be converted to UCUM units for WMS and SOS GetCapabilities responses. 
--&gt;
&lt;units_standard&gt;UDUNITS&lt;/units_standard&gt;

&lt;!-- For the wms examples, pick one of your grid datasets that has
longitude and latitude axes.
The sample variable must be a variable in the sample grid dataset.
The bounding box values are minx,miny,maxx,maxy.
--&gt;
&lt;wmsSampleDatasetID&gt;erdBAssta5day&lt;/wmsSampleDatasetID&gt;
&lt;wmsSampleVariable&gt;sst&lt;/wmsSampleVariable&gt;
&lt;!-- The bounding box values are 
   minLongitude,minLatitude,maxLongitude,maxLatitude.
   Longitude values within -180 to 180, or 0 to 360, are now okay. --&gt;
&lt;wmsSampleBBox&gt;0,-75,360,75&lt;/wmsSampleBBox&gt;
</pre>

  <li>REQUIRED: In setup.xml, copy and paste this new suggested <tt>&lt;startHeadHtml&gt;</tt> 
  to replace your old version.
    But feel free to make changes for your preferences.
<pre>
&lt;!-- startHeadHtml has the start of the HTML document and the 
'head' tags (starting at "&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;", but not including 
"&lt;/head&gt;") for all HTML web pages. 
This may include &amp;erddapUrl;, which is expanded to be 
  [baseUrl]/erddap (or [baseUttpsUrl]/erddap if the user is logged in).
If your ERDDAP allows users to log in, all referenced image files, 
  css files, etc. must be in [tomcat]/content/erddap/images or a 
  subdirectory and must be referenced here with 
  &amp;erddapUrl;/images/[fileName].

favicon.ico is the image that browsers associate with your website.
More more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon .
You can use your own favicon.ico file by putting it in 
  [tomcat]/content/erddap/images. 

*** Optional: you can change the appearance of all of your 
ERDDAP's HTML pages by changing the CSS &lt;style&gt; settings below.

For an example of a very different style, change the import reference
to &lt;tomcat&gt;/content/erddap/images/erddapAlt.css

*** If your CSS style includes links to files (e.g., images), that 
style information must be inline in the style tag below, after the
'import' line, not in the .css file.  
Put all of the (e.g., image) files in the 
[tomcat]/content/erddap/images directory (or a subdirectory) and 
reference them below starting with &amp;erddapUrl;.
Why? On ERDDAP https: web pages, *all* links should use "https:" 
(not "http:"); otherwise, most browsers consider the web page not 
fully secure.  Because ERDDAP would use the same .css file for 
http: and https: web pages, the links within the .css file wouldn't 
switch between http: and https:.  There doesn't seem to be a way 
around this other than using inline style information.
--&gt;
&lt;startHeadHtml&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ 
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;ERDDAP&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="&amp;erddapUrl;/images/favicon.ico"&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--
  @import "&amp;erddapUrl;/images/erddap.css";
--&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
]]&gt;&lt;/startHeadHtml&gt;

&lt;!-- The tableCommonBGColor MUST be the same color as the 
   table.commonBGColor in erddap.css above. Suggested is #f1ecd8. 
   But if you use erddapAlt.css, change this to #e7dec5. --&gt;
&lt;tableCommonBGColor&gt;#f1ecd8&lt;/tableCommonBGColor&gt;

&lt;!-- This is used, e.g., for the type=variable rows on the metadata
  info tables. --&gt;
&lt;tableHighlightBGColor&gt;#cceecc&lt;/tableHighlightBGColor&gt;
</pre>
    Thanks to POST, Hans Vedo, and Rick Blair.
  <li>REQUIRED: In setup.xml, in <tt>&lt;startBodyHtml&gt;</tt>, 
    change the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> tag to be just <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>,
    since the style is now set by erddap.css.
  <li>REQUIRED: In setup.xml, change to this <tt>&lt;endBodyHtml&gt;</tt> 
    (but change the email address to your 
    email address and feel free to make other changes):
<pre>
&lt;!-- The end of the body of the HTML code for all HTML web pages
  (with "&lt;/body&gt;" at the end). 
This may include &amp;erddapUrl;, which is expanded to be 
  [baseUrl]/erddap (or [baseUttpsUrl]/erddap if the user is logged in).
If your ERDDAP allows users to log in, all referenced image files, etc. 
  must be in [tomcat]/content/erddap/images or a subdirectory
  and must be referenced here with &amp;erddapUrl;/images/[fileName].

You can change this, but please keep "ERDDAP, Version &amp;erddapVersion;"
and these references to the Disclaimers and Privacy Policy. --&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
]]&gt;&lt;/endBodyHtml&gt;
</pre>
  <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: In setup.xml, the recommended <tt>&lt;theShortDescriptionHtml&gt;</tt>
  is now 
<pre>
&lt;theShortDescriptionHtml&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ 
&lt;h1&gt;ERDDAP&lt;/h1&gt;
This web site (the Environmental Research Division's Data Access 
Program) aggregates scientific data from diverse local and remote 
sources and offers you a simple, consistent way to download subsets 
of the data in common file formats and make graphs and maps.
This particular ERDDAP installation has oceanographic data
(for example, data from satellites and buoys).

[standardShortDescriptionHtml]
]]&gt;&lt;/theShortDescriptionHtml&gt;
</pre>
     Feel free to change this, particularly the last sentence in the first paragraph.
  <li>In setup.xml, emailEverythingTo and emailDailyReportTo can now be comma-separated lists of email 
    addresses. The first emailEverythingTo is special, e.g., subscriptions to EDDXxxxFromErddap 
    datasets use that email address. Thanks to John Maurer.
  <li>Email errors are now logged to the [bigParentDirectory]/logs/emailLogYYYY-MM-DD.txt file.
  <li>In setup.xml, there is a new, optional parameter to set email account properties (usually right after
    <tt>&lt;emailPassword&gt;</tt>): 
    <br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;emailProperties&gt;<i>propertyName1</i>|<i>propertyValue1</i>|<i>propertyName2</i>|
      <i>propertyValue2</i>|...&lt;/emailProperties&gt;
    </tt>
    <br>For example, gmail accounts need <br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;emailProperties&gt;mail.smtp.starttls.enable|true&lt;/emailProperties&gt;</tt>
    <br>The default is nothing.
    Thanks to Rich Signell.

  <li>REQUIRED: If you use EDDTableCopy or EDDGridCopy, you must DELETE all
     [bigParentDirectory]/copy/ directories and files that contain "xh" in the directory 
     or file names after stopping the old ERDDAP and before starting the new ERDDAP 
     so those files will be re-copied.
     I'm very sorry, but it was important to make the change and hopefully it affects few admins and 
     few files.
     <br>In Linux, you can find these files with,  
        <tt>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd [bigParentDirectory]/copy
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;find . *xh*
        </tt>
     <br>In Windows, you can find these files with,  
        <tt>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Start | Search
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to search for: Documents
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All or part of the file name: xh
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look in: Browse -> [bigParentDirectory]/copy
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on 'Search'
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^A to select them all 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Del to delete them all
        </tt>
  <li>REQUIRED: In datasets.xml, for EDDTableFromDatabase datasets, for date and timestamp variables,
    change the dataType to <tt>double</tt> and the units to 
    <tt>seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z</tt>.
    We REQUIRE that you store timestamp data in the database *with* a timezone.
    Without timezone information, the queries that ERDDAP sends to the database and the results that 
    ERDDAP gets from the database via JDBC are ambiguous and are likely to be wrong. 
    We tried, but found no reliable way to deal with "timestamp without timezone" data.
    We think this is good practice anyway. 
    After all, "timestamp without timezone" data has an implied timezone. 
    While it is great that the time zone is obvious to the database admin, it makes sense to specify it     
    explicitly so that other software can properly interact with your database. Thanks/sorry Michael Urzen.
  <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: In datasets.xml, to enable .subset web pages for faceted search of your tabular datasets, 
    you need to add 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#subsetVariables">
      <tt>&lt;subsetVariables&gt;</tt></a> to the dataset's global attributes. 
  <li>RECOMMENDED: In datasets.xml, if you have the dataset with datasetID="pmelGtsppp", 
    please change it to be
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&lt;dataset type="EDDTableFromDapSequence" datasetID="pmelGtsppp" active="false"&gt;</tt>
    <br>Whether or not you had that dataset, feel free to add this new GTSPP dataset:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&lt;dataset type="EDDTableFromErddap" datasetID="erdGtsppBest"&gt;    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;sourceUrl&gt;http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/erdGtsppBest&lt;/sourceUrl&gt;
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/dataset&gt;</tt>
  <li>RECOMMENDED: In datasets.xml, there are new valid options for the 
     <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#cdm_data_type"><tt>&lt;cdm_data_type&gt;</tt></a> global attribute, 
     so you should review/change the value for your datasets.
  <li>In datasets.xml, the new 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#sourceNeedsExpandedFP_EQ"><tt>&lt;sourceNeedsExpandedFP_EQ&gt;</tt></a> is helpful if the source server doesn't   
    consistently handle <tt>&amp;<i>variable</i>=<i>value</i></tt> tests correctly
    (because of the 
      <a href="http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm">general 
      difficulty of testing the equality of floating point numbers<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>). 
    <tt>sourceNeedsExpandedFP_EQ</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt> by default (the safest setting), 
      so you don't need to make
    any changes.
  <li>New 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromAsciiFiles">EDDTableFromAsciiFiles</a>. Thanks to Jerry Yun Pan.
  <li>New
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromThreddsFiles">EDDTableFromThreddsFiles</a>.  Thanks to Roy Mendelssohn.
  <li>Changes to 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromNcFiles">EDDTableFromNcFiles</a> lets it be used with a wider range of files. 
  <li>EDDTableFromBMDE has been disabled. There are no longer any active, appropriate, data sources.
  <li>In GenerateDatasetXml, the new EDDGridFromThreddsCatalog harvests an entire THREDDS catalog
    (or a subset) and generates datasets.xml content. Thanks to the UAF project.
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml and DasDds now also put their results in [bigParentDirectory]/logs/log.txt.
    Thanks to Rich Signell and Charles Carleton.
  <li>Many improvements to the login system. Thanks to POST.
  </ul>

<li><b>Things ERDDAP Programmers Need to Know and Do:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>There have been changes in the /WEB-INF/lib/ directory. Please change your javac and java 
    classpath settings accordingly.
  <li>There is a new [yourUrl]/erddap/version service to determine the version of an ERDDAP. 
     The response is text, e.g., <tt>ERDDAP_version=1.24</tt>  
     If you get an HTTP 404 Not-Found error message, treat the ERDDAP as version 1.22 or lower. 
     Thanks to POST.
  </ul>

<li><b>Small Changes and Bug Fixes:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>EDDTableFromSos changes:
    <ul>
    <li>Dropped support for reading IOOS SOS XML responses.
    <li>Added support for reading IOOS SOS text/csv. (So NOS SOS servers currently aren't supported.)
    <li>Made lots of changes related to IOOS SOS server details.
    <li>Added support for BBOX queries for IOOS SOS and OOSTethys SOS servers.
    </ul>
    These changes result in a big speed up for relevant data requests.
    Thanks to IOOS SOS.
  <li>Text in .mat tabular data files is now saved correctly.  Thanks to Roy Mendelssohn.
  <li>WMS
    <ul>
    <li>OpenLayers is now bundled with ERDDAP for use on the WMS web pages. 
      This fixes the problem caused when OpenLayers changed a few months ago and prevents future problems.
    <li>In the WMS GetCapabilities response, the <tt>&lt;OnlineResource&gt;</tt> value is now 
      the URL of the WMS service.  Thanks to Charlton Galvarino.
    <li>A legend is displayed on the WMS web page to show the colorbar. Thanks to Emilio Mayorga.    
    </ul>
  <li>EDDGridAggregateExistingDimension constructor had problems if an axis' sourceValues weren't
    equal to their destinationValues, e.g., if source time was something other than 
    "seconds since 1970-01-01".  Thanks to Todd Spindler.  
  <li>In TableWriterGeoJson, the excess ',' after <tt>bbox[...]</tt> as been removed. Thanks to Greg Williams. 
  <li>Many small changes and bug fixes.

<li>ERDDAP administrators, please add this to your setup.xml file:
<pre>
&lt;!-- If you want to restrict access to some datasets, you need to 
specify the method used for logging on (authentication). See the info 
at http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#security
Currently, the options are: "" (logins not supported, the default),
"custom", "openid". Note that openid login doesn't work when testing 
with localhost (https://127.0.0.1:8443).
--&gt;
&lt;authentication&gt;&lt;/authentication&gt;

&lt;!-- This specifies how you have stored passwords in the roles tags 
in datasets.xml. If you aren't storing any passwords this is irrelevant.
The options (in order of increasing security) are: "plaintext", "MD5", 
or "UEPMD5" (MD5(UserName:ERDDAP:Password), the default).
You should only use "plaintext" or "MD5" if you need to match values 
stored that way in an external password database.  See the info at

<li>New dataset types 
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridCopy">EDDGridCopy</a>
  and
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableCopy">EDDTableCopy</a>
  make and maintain a local copy 
  of another EDDGrid or EDDTable dataset's data and serve data from the local copy. 
  These are very easy to use and very effective 
  <b>solutions to some of the biggest problems with serving data from remote data sources:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Accessing data from a remote data source can be slow (for a variety of reasons).
  <li>The remote dataset is sometimes unavailable (again, for a variety of reasons).
  <li>Relying on one source for the data doesn't scale well (e.g., when many users and many ERDDAPs 
    utilize it).
  </ul>
  Plus, the local copy is a backup of the original, which is useful in case something happens to the original.

  <p>There is nothing new about making a local copy of a dataset. What is new here is that these classes
  make it *easy* to create and *maintain* a local copy of data from a *variety* of types 
  of remote data sources and *add metadata* while copying the data.

  <p>These dataset types are part of a complete set of features that simplify the creation of 
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/grids.html">grids/clusters/federations of 
  ERDDAPs</a> 
  to handle very heavy loads (e.g., in a data center).

<li>New dataset type
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromDatabase">EDDTableFromDatabase</a>
  gets data from a local or remote database table.
<li>ERDDAP now has a <a href="#security">security</a> system that supports authentication (letting users log in)
  and authorization (granting them access to certain private datasets).
<li>There are 
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#Tools">two, new, command-line tools</a>
    to help ERDDAP administrators generate the XML for a new dataset 
  in datasets.xml:
  <ul>
  <li>GenerateDatasetsXml can generate a rough draft of the dataset XML for almost any type of datasets.
  <li>DasDds helps you repeatedly test and refine the XML for a dataset.
  </ul>
  ERDDAP's GenerateDatasetsXml web pages have been removed. For security reasons, they only supported
  a few dataset types. The new command line tools are a better solution.
<li>The new <a href="#statusPage">status page</a> lets anyone (but especially administrators)
    view the status of an ERDDAP 
  from any browser by going to [baseUrl]/erddap/status.html .
<li>Tabledap now supports      
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html#functions">server-side functions</a>:
  <ul>
  <li>&amp;distinct() removes duplicate rows from the response table,
  <li>&amp;orderBy(...) lets you specify how the response table should be sorted,
  <li>&amp;orderByMax(...) lets you specify how the response table should be sorted and removes all rows 
    except for the rows with the maximum values in the last specified column.
    This can be used, for example, to get the last available data for each station.
  </ul>
<li>Tabular datasets can now include additional dateTime variables which aren't named "time".
  These variables are recognized by their "units" metadata, which must contain 
  " since " (for numeric dateTimes)
  or "yy" or "YY" (for formatted String dateTimes).
  But please still use the destinationName "time" for the main dateTime variable.
<li>ERDDAP now generates a <a href="#sitemap">sitemap.xml</a> file, which tells search engines that your ERDDAP
  only needs to be crawled every month.
  ERDDAP administrators, please follow <a href="#sitemap">these instructions</a> to 
    notify the search engines about the new 
  sitemap.xml file.
<li>ERDDAP's error messages are now much shorter and geared to clients (not programmers).
   Thanks to Greg Williams.
<li><a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#requestBlacklist"><tt>&lt;requestBlacklist&gt;</tt></a>
now also supports IP addresses where the last number has been replaced by *.
<li>Requests for .json and .geoJson files may now include an optional 
  <a href="http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/">jsonp<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> request
  by adding "&amp;.jsonp=<i>functionName</i>" to the end of the query.
  Basically, this just tells ERDDAP to add "<i>functionName</i>(" to the beginning of the response and
  ")" to the end of the response.
  If originally there was no query, leave off the "&amp;" in your query.
  Thanks to Greg Williams.
<li>Lots of new statistics were added to the <a href="#dailyReport">Daily Report</a>.
<li>On web pages with lists of datasets, institution and id are now at the far right.
  This moves subscription and other more useful columns into view on narrow computer screens.
<li>On all web pages, the page's title (based on the <tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt> 
  in the <tt>&lt;startHeadHtml&gt;</tt> 
  that you define in setup.xml) is modified to include a better description of the web page
  (for example, by including the current dataset's title and institution).
<li>Xmx information is now included with the memory information printed in log.txt, the Daily Report,
  and on status.html. Thanks to Ellyn Montgomery.
<li>Erddap has additional, general-purpose protection against all errors (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).
  Thanks to Charles Carleton.
<li>Improvements to error handling if the response has already been committed.
<li>Change: EDDTableFromFiles and EDDGridFromFiles now just allow <tt>&lt;metadataFrom&gt;</tt>
  <tt>first</tt> or <tt>last</tt>.
  <tt>penultimate</tt> is no longer supported.
  And first and last are now based on the files' lastModifiedTime.
<li>Bug fix: in EDDTableFromSOS, invalid info for one station threw an exception 
  and caused the whole dataset to be rejected. Now, those stations are just ignored 
  (and the error message is logged to log.txt). Thanks to Rick Blair.
  <br>&nbsp;  
</ul>

<h2><a name="changes1.18">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.18 (released 2009-04-08)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: Starting in 1.14, the EDDTable Data Access Form and Make A Graph web page didn't properly 
  deal with quoted constraints.
<li>Bug fix: Starting in 1.14, EDDTableFromDapSequence didn't handle time constraints correctly if the 
  source time units weren't "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00".
  <br>&nbsp;
</ul>

<h2><a name="changes1.16">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.16 (released 2009-03-26)</h2>
<ul>
<li>ERDDAP administrators:
  <ul>
  <li>This is an important release because it fixes a bug that left an ERDDAP thread running 
    if you used Tomcat Manager to Stop/Start or Reload ERDDAP.
    So when you install 1.16, don't just use Tomcat manager to undeploy the old ERDDAP and deploy the 
    new ERDDAP.
    Instead: <b>undeploy the old ERDDAP, restart Tomcat (or the server), then deploy the new ERDDAP.</b>
    It's always a good idea to do that when installing a new version.
  <li>Please add 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html"><tt>&lt;requestBlacklist&gt;&lt;/requestBlacklist&gt;</tt></a>
    to your datasets.xml.
    This can be used to specify a list of client IP addresses to be blocked 
    (e.g., to fend off a Denial of Service attack or an overly zealous web robot).
  </ul>
<li>There is now a [bigParentDirectory]/logs directory to hold the ERDDAP log files.
  When you start ERDDAP, it makes an archive copy of the log.txt and log.txt.previous files with a 
  time stamp. If there was trouble before the restart, it may be useful to analyze these files.
<li>ERD's ERDDAP now has the subscription system turned on.
<li>ERDDAP once again allows (but still doesn't recommend) the "%26" encoding of "&amp;" in request URLs 
  (see the <a href="#percent26">related v1.14 change</a>). 
<li>Several new additions to the Tally section of the <a href="#dailyReport">Daily Report</a>.
<li>Small bug fixes in generateDatasetsXml.
<li>A few small bug fixes.
  <br>&nbsp;
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes1.14">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.14 (released 2009-03-17)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changes for users:
  <ul>
  <li>In grid data requests, ERDDAP now supports: 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/documentation.html#last">last-n</a> 
      where n is an integer number of indices and
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/documentation.html#lastInParentheses">(last-d)</a>
      where d is a numeric value (for time, it is in seconds).
  <li>In tabular data requests, String constraints now require 
     <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html#DoubleQuotes">double quotes</a>
     around the value, for example,
     <tt>&amp;id="NDBC40121"</tt>
     This is required by the DAP protocol.
  <li>In tabular data requests, ERDDAP now requires that 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html#PercentEncode">all constraints be properly percent encoded</a>. 
    Browsers do this automatically, so this mostly affects computer programs/scripts that are
    accessing ERDDAP.
  <li><a name="percent26">Previously,</a> the
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/embed.html">embed a graph web page</a> and the 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/gadgets/GoogleGadgets.html">ERDDAP Google Gadget web page</a>
    said to replace the "&amp;" in the image's URL with "%26".
    From now on, you should replace the "&amp;" in the image's URL with "&amp;amp;".
    So you need to replace any "%26" in existing web pages and Google Gadgets with "&amp;amp;". (Sorry)
  </ul>
<li>ERDDAP administrators, please:
  <ul>
  <li>Add the following to your <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a> file (and change the flagKeyKey value):
    <pre>
&lt;!-- ERDDAP has a service that lets remote users set a flag
to notify ERDDAP to try to reload a dataset.
These requests use a key which is generated based
on baseUrl/warName, a datasetID, and flagKeyKey.
*** Change this once, to any text (a favorite quote? random text? 
It doesn't matter). Normally, you won't ever change this again.
But if you you think someone is abusing the flag system,
change this text again, restart ERDDAP, and send
all of the users of the flag system the relevant new flagKeys
(see the list in the Daily Report). --&gt;
&lt;flagKeyKey&gt;A stitch in time saves nine. CHANGE THIS!!!&lt;/flagKeyKey&gt;

&lt;!-- ERDDAP has an email/URL subscription system which sends a user
an email or pings a url whenever a dataset of interest changes.
(This is different from the RSS system, which is always active.)
The system relies on the server being able to send out 
emails to people to validate their subscription requests.
The emails appear to come from the emailFromAddress below.
So if your server can't send out emails, don't make this system active.
You may choose (for whatever reason) to make this system active or not, 
so valid values below are "true" (the default) and "false".
Note that if you change this and restart ERDDAP, the list of 
subscriptions (in [bigParentDirectory]/subscriptionsV1.txt) isn't
affected. See also the subscriptionEmailBlacklist in datasets.xml.
--&gt;
&lt;subscriptionSystemActive&gt;true&lt;/subscriptionSystemActive&gt;  </pre>
  <li>On the line after <tt>&lt;emailUserName&gt;</tt> in in <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a>, add
    <br><tt>&lt;emailPassword&gt;<i>myPassword</i>&lt;/emailPassword&gt; &lt;!-- optional; if absent, emails
      can't be sent to non-local addresses &gt;</tt>
    <br>and enter your real password.
  <li>You can change <tt>&lt;wmsSampleBBox&gt;</tt> in <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a> to include longitude values up to 360, e.g., 
    <pre>
&lt;!-- The bounding box values are 
   minLongitude,minLatitude,maxLongitude,maxLatitude.
   Longitude values within -180 to 180, or 0 to 360, are now okay. --&gt;
&lt;wmsSampleBBox&gt;0,-75,360,75&lt;/wmsSampleBBox&gt;  </pre>
  <li>In your datasets.xml file, rename dataset type EDDTableFromNc4DFiles to EDDTableFromNcFiles
    (which now supports files with any number of dimensions).
    If you had an EDDTableFromNc4DFiles dataset:
    <ol>
    <li>You MUST change to type="EDDTableFromNcFiles" in your datasets.XML file.
    <li>You MUST add a <tt>&lt;nDimensions&gt;4&lt;/nDimensions&gt;</tt> tag to the dataset's XML.
    <li>You may add the new <tt>&lt;sortFilesBySourceNames&gt;</tt>
      tag to specify the internal order for the files,
      which determines the overall order of the data returned.
    </ol>
    For details, see <a   href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromFiles">EDDTableFromFiles</a>.
  <li>In the past, for EDDTableFromDapSequence, for OPeNDAP DRDS servers, in datasets.xml, we used 
    <tt>&lt;sourceCanConstrainStringsRegex&gt;~=&lt;/sourceCanConstrainStringRegex&gt;</tt>.
    But we now see that the DRDS regex support is more limited than ERDDAP's, so we recommend
    <tt>&lt;sourceCanConstrainStringsRegex&gt;&lt;/sourceCanConstrainStringRegex&gt;</tt>
    so that regex constraints are not passed to the source, but are instead handled by ERDDAP.
  <li>Revamped handling of sourceCanConstrain... in datasets.xml by 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromDapSequence">EDDTableFromDapSequence</a> 
    and (internally) all EDDTable dataset types.  
    The new system is simpler and better reflects the variability of different data sources.
    You may need to modify the XML for your datasets in datasets.xml.
  </ul>
<li>There are several new features which are useful by themselves, 
  but when combined, also facilitate the creation of 
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#grids">grids/clusters/federations of ERDDAPs</a>.
  <ul>
  <li>New dataset types:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridFromErddap">EDDGridFromErddap</a> 
      and 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromErddap">EDDTableFromErddap</a>
      which let one ERDDAP include a dataset 
      from another ERDDAP in a very simple and very efficient way.
    <li><a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridFromFiles">EDDGridFromFiles</a> 
      (and its subclass, 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridFromNcFiles">EDDGridFromNcFiles</a> 
      which can read NetCDF .nc, 
      GRIB .grb, and HDF .hdf files).
    <li><a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromNcFiles">EDDTableFromNcFiles</a>
      which can read NetCDF .nc which have a table-like structure.
    </ul>
  <li>RunLoadDatasets and LoadDatasets were revamped so that ERDDAP is very responsive to reloading 
    datasets based on files in the 
      <a href="#flag">flag</a> directory (often &lt;5 seconds if main loadDatasets is currently done).
  <li>New service to allow <a href="#setDatasetFlag">a URL to create a flag file</a> for a given dataset, e.g.,
   <br>http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/setDatasetFlag.txt?datasetID=rPmelTao&amp;flagKey=123456789
   <br>creates a flag file in the flag directory for rPmelTao (although the flagKey here is wrong). 
  <li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/subscriptions">subscription</a> 
        service so that any client can specify an action 
    which will be done when a specific dataset is created (when ERDDAP is restarted) and 
    whenever the dataset changes in any way.
    This system can be disabled via <tt>&lt;subscriptionSystemActive&gt;</tt> in <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a>.
    The ERDDAP <a href="#dailyReport">Daily Report</a> now lists all of the subscriptions and includes
    the URL needed to cancel each one, in case you feel the system is being abused.
    In datasets.xml, there is a new, optional 
      <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#subscriptionsEmailBlacklist"><tt>&lt;subscriptionsEmailBlacklist&gt;</tt></a> tag so that administrators 
    can specify a comma-separated list of email address which are immediately blacklisted from the 
    subscription system.
  <li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#onChange"><tt>&lt;onChange&gt;</tt></a> 
        attribute in datasets.xml lets the ERDDAP administrator specify an action 
    which will be done when a specific dataset is created (when ERDDAP is restarted) and 
    whenever the dataset changes in any way.
  <li>Improvements to full text search: storing the search string for each dataset now uses 1/2 the memory.
    The search algorithm (Boyer-Moore-like) is now 3X faster.
  <li>Emails from ERDDAP now always prepend the subject and content with [erddapUrl],
    so that it will be clear which ERDDAP this came from (in case you administer multiple ERDDAPs).
  <li>More extensive statistics gathering for the <a href="#dailyReport">Daily Report</a> email.
  <li>New log file [bigParentDirectory]/emailLogYEAR-MM-DD.txt logs all emails sent by ERDDAP each day.
    This is especially useful if your server can't actually send emails -- you can at least read them 
    in the log.
  <li>ERDDAP now makes a [bigParentDirectory]/cache/(datasetID) directory for each dataset since 
    there may be lots of files cached.
  </ul>
<li>New <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/information.html#subscriptions">RSS 2.01</a> 
  feed for each dataset (look for the orange RSS icons on lists of datasets, Data Access Forms,
  and Make A Graph web pages).
<li> EDDGrid .kml responses now use tiled images ("superoverlays" - dynamically generated quadtree images).
  The initial image loads into GoogleEarth much faster than before.
  The resolution of the map increases as you zoom in, up to the full resolution of the dataset.
  Recommend: users should request .kml for one time point, 
  but the dataset's entire longitude,latitude range.
  Unfortunately, support for time ranges was removed (I hope it will come back).
<li>ERDDAP now adds 
  <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/05/high_performanc_2.html">Expires and Cache-Control max-age headers<img 
      src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> 
  to all files requested from the 
  /images directory.
  This greatly reduces the number of static file requests sent to ERDDAP
  and thus greatly speeds up most ERDDAP page loads.
  Also, many JavaScript file references moved to the bottom of their HTML pages,
  which also speeds up many ERDDAP page loads.
  Thanks to the book "High Performance Web Sites" by Steve Souders and the ySlow addition to the 
  FireBug plugin in FireFox.
<li>ERDDAP switched from netcdf-java 2.2.22 to netcdf-java 4.0.
  Among other things, this allows EDDGridFromNcFiles to read HDF .hdf, as well as GRIB .grb and
  NetCDF .nc files.
<li>EDDGridFromDap and EDDGridFromNcFiles now also support DArray (as well as DGrid) dataVariables.
  If a dimension doesn't have a corresponding coordinate variables,
  ERDDAP creates an axis variable with the index values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ..., 311, 312).
  So all other aspects of EDDGrid remain the same:
  <br>* It still serves all datasets as Grids, with an axis variable for each dimension.
  <br>* Queries can still request values from the axis variables.
  <br>Thanks to Charles Carleton, Thomas Im, Dorian Raymer, and others.
<li>The WMS OpenLayers pages now have a default longitude,latitude range that is a little larger than the
  dataset's range (not the exact range, so the context of small datasets is more obvious).
  The default range may now also be 0 to 360, which allows the full range of many datasets to be shown now.
  Thanks to Todd Spindler.
<li>New sliders on some Data Access Forms and Make A Graph web pages.
  They simplify (crude) specification of the desired data and offer good visual feedback.
<li>A new option for the <tt>&lt;dataset&gt;</tt> tags in datasets.xml: 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#active">active="false"</a>.
<li>References to ERD's ERDDAP changed from coastwatch.pfel (still works via proxy) to coastwatch.pfeg
  (preferred).
<li>New support for 
    <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#data_min">data_min and data_max</a> variable metadata attributes.
<li>A partial solution to the <a href="#waitThenTryAgain">WaitThenTryAgain / Partial Results Exception</a>:
  Now, some requests that previously failed when a data source change was detected
  will succeed because ERDDAP will reload the dataset and re-request the data automatically,
  all in the context of the original request.
<li>Bug fix: generateDatasetsXml was disabled in ERDDAP version 1.12.
  Thanks to Ellyn Montgomery for pointing this out.
<li>Small changes to error handling.
<li>Many improvements to avoid/deal with possible race conditions (i.e., possible problems arising 
  from the multi-threaded nature of ERDDAP) which caused small, infrequent problems.
<li>Now, if an error message is written on an image, the image will only stay in the cache for
  ~5-10 minutes (not 60). Thanks to Cara Wilson.
<li>The standard message when there is no data is now "Your query produced no matching results.", 
  which is shorter, more accurate, and matches OPeNDAP servers.
<li>EDDGrid no longer allows tied axis values.
<li>Small changes to .ver and .help requests.
<li>Many small changes and bug fixes.
  <br>&nbsp;
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes1.12">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.12 (released 2008-10-31)</h2>
<ul>
<li>EDDTableFromSOS once again works with NDBC SOS and works with the new NOS SOS.
<li>EDDTableFromBMDE now requires ERDDAP admin to specify dataVariables.
<li>EDDGrid no longer requires that lat and lon be evenly spaced for .transparentPng or .kml.
  Thanks to Todd Spindler.
<li>A few small changes.
  <br>&nbsp;
</ul>


<h2><a name="changes1.10">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.10 (released 2008-10-14)</h2>
<ul>
<li>New "colorBar" metadata for data variables in datasets.xml defines the default color bar settings 
  for graphs and maps. See 
<a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#colorBar">more information</a>.
  This is important because it greatly improves the appearance of the default graphs and maps 
  produced by Make A Graph and because the default graphs and maps now have a consistent color
  bar even when the client changes the requested time or geographic range.
  Also, this was necessary for WMS.
<li> ERDDAP now serves most grid data via a WMS service. This is important because it shows that, 
  in addition to getting data from many types of data servers, ERDDAP can distribute data via 
  different protocols (DAP, WMS, ... more in future).  See the
<a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/wms/documentation.html">client documentation</a>.
  Or the
<a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#WMS">documentation for administrators</a>. 
  Or  
<a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/wms/index.html">try it out</a>. 
<li> New support for longitude values &gt;180 in .kml files.
<li> New cdm_data_type: Other .
<li> ERDDAP now supports "boolean" source dataType.  See
<a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#booleanData">more information</a>
  This will become useful for the future EDDTableFromDatabase.
<li> New EDDTableFromBMDE supports DiGIR/BMDE data sources.
<li> EDVGridAxis now allows descending sorted values. The pmelOscar datasets needed this.
<li> ERDDAP now returns HTTP errors (e.g., "404 for resource/page not found") in more situations, 
  instead of HTML pages with error messages.
<li> Lots of changes/additions to the ERDDAP documentation.
<li> Lots of small changes.
<li> Some bug fixes.

<li><b>Things ERDDAP administrators should do to upgrade to this version:</b>
<ul>
<li>In datasets.xml, for any EDDTableFromSOS datasets, change "observedProperty" metadata to 
  "sourceObservedProperty".
<li>The rules for an axisVariable or dataVariable's destinationName are now 
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#dataVariable">stricter</a>. 
  You need to check that your variable names are valid.
  Either check them by hand, or run ERDDAP and look at the error messages in the report that is 
  emailed to the administrator.
<li>In datasets.xml, if you want a grid data variable to be accessible via WMS, you need to add 
  colorBar metadata. At least, for example,<tt>
  <br> &nbsp; &lt;att name="colorBarMinimum" type="double"&gt;0&lt;/att&gt;
  <br> &nbsp; &lt;att name="colorBarMaximum" type="double"&gt;32&lt;/att&gt;</tt>
  <br>See
<a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#WMS">more information</a>.

<li>Add the following to your <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a> (but customize with your information): <pre>

&lt;!-- drawLand specifies the default Make A Graph setting for 
whether the landmask should be drawn "over" (the default) or "under" 
surface data on maps. "over" is recommended for primarily 
oceanographic data (so that grid data over land is obscured by the 
landmask). "under" is recommended for all other data.
--&gt;
&lt;drawLand&gt;over&lt;/drawLand&gt;

<h2><a name="changes1.08">Changes</a> in ERDDAP version 1.08 (released 2008-07-13)</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> A new web service in ERDDAP, generateDatasetsXml, assists ERDDAP administrators by creating 
    a rough draft of the XML needed to describe a dataset in datasets.xml
  <li> Some changes/bug fixes related to allowing griddap to be seen by netcdf-java as an opendap server, 
    including: global metadata is now labeled "NC_GLOBAL" (instead of "GLOBAL").
  <li> The EDDGrid and EDDTable Data Access Forms now utilize query information in the URL.  
    So, for example, if a user goes from a Make A Graph form to a Data Access Form, 
    the constraints are now properly transferred.
  <li> tabledap's Make A Graph now allows constraints on String variables.
  <li> EDDTable's Make A Graph now allows NaN constraints. Thanks to Steve Hankin.
  <li> Bug fix: EDDTable saveAsImage didn't properly recognize the .colorbar min and max values. 
    Thanks to Steve Hankin
  <li> Many improvements to setupDatasetsXml. Thanks to Ellyn Montgomery.
  <li> Griddap requests now allow ()-style requests slightly outside of the actual axis range. 
    This is appropriate since ()-values are rounded to the nearest actual value.
    Thanks to Cindy Bessey
  <li> I made the FloatArray and DoubleArray test of isEvenlySpaced more sophisticated.  
    It will always be imperfect (because the test would need to be customized for each dataset), 
    but it should be better.  Thanks to Ellyn Montgomery.
  <li> I moved setup.html and setupDatasetsXml.html erddap's /download directory and hard coded all
    links to them.  Now, I can make changes and update the setup information immediately.
  <li>Many small changes. A few small bug fixes.
  <li><b>Things ERDDAP administrators should do to upgrade to this version:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Move <tt>&lt;theShortDescriptionHtml&gt;</tt> from your messages.xml to your <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a>.
      It specifies the text that appears in the middle of the left side of the ERDDAP home page. 
      Also, add <tt>&lt;h1&gt;ERDDAP&lt;/h1&gt;</tt> (or some other headline) to the top of it.
      <b>Or,</b> copy <tt>&lt;theShortDescriptionHtml&gt;</tt> in the new 
        <a href="#setup.xml">setup.xml</a> 
        (from the new erddapContent.zip) into your setup.xml.
      <br>&nbsp;
    </ul>
