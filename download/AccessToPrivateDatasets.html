<h1 style="text-align:center;">Access to Private Datasets in ERDDAP™</h1>

<p>Many ERDDAP™ installations don't have authentication enabled and thus 
don't provide any way for users to login, nor do they have any private datasets. 

<p>Some ERDDAP™ installations do have authentication enabled. 
Currently, ERDDAP™ only supports authentication via Google-managed email accounts,
which includes email accounts at NOAA and many universities.
If an ERDDAP™ has authentication enabled, anyone with a Google-managed email account
can log in, but they will only have access to the private datasets
that the ERDDAP™ administrator has explicitly authorized them to access.


<h2>Humans With Browsers</h2>

Human users of ERDDAP™ can log into ERDDAP™ in a browser in order to gain access
to private datasets that they are authorized to access.

<p>To log in:
<ol>
<li>Click on the <kbd>log in</kbd> link in the upper left of any ERDDAP™ web page.
  <br>If there is no <kbd>log in</kbd> link, the ERDDAP™ installation
    doesn't have authentication enabled and there are no private datasets. 
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Click on the <kbd>Sign in</kbd> button to sign into your Google account.
  <br>The text of the button should change to "Signed in".
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Click on the <kbd>Log into ERDDAP</kbd> button.
  <br>The web page should change to say <kbd>You are logged in as <i>yourEmailAddress</i></kbd> .
  <br>If it doesn't, wait 5 seconds and click on the <kbd>Log into ERDDAP</kbd> button again.
  <br>In extreme cases, you may have to wait and then try again a few times.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Don't use your browser's Back button. 
  Use the "ERDDAP" link at the top of the above, 
  then use other links to go to ERDDAP™ pages you are interested in. 
  If a cached web page says you aren't logged in, reload the page.
  <br>&nbsp;
</ol>

<h2>Scripts</h2>

[This is slightly modified from information provided by Lynn DeWitt, who did the hard 
job of figuring this out. Lynn, thank you very much!
<br>If you have corrections or suggestions, please email erd.data @ noaa.gov .]

<p>It is also possible to log in to ERDDAP™ and access private datasets via 
a script.  Here is an example which uses curl:

<ol>
<li>These instructions assume you are using a gmail address where 
2-factor authentication is not turned on. If your main gmail address 
has 2-factor authentication turned on, consider creating another 
gmail address with 2-factor authentication turned off.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> Log in to ERDDAP™ manually with the gmail address you want use in your 
script and accept any permissions required, then log completely back out.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> Open the browser Developer Tools, and go to the Network tab.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> Click on the ERDDAP™ "log in" link, then the "Sign in" button and choose
the appropriate email address if prompted.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> After the "Sign in" button changes to "Signed in", the
Developer Tools Network tab will show two entries that look like the following  
(example from Firefox):
<br>iframerpc?action=issueToken&amp;response
        loginGoogle.html
<br>Use the mouse right-click context menu to "copy as cURL" both of 
these urls and paste them into a plain text editor
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> Click on the "Log into ERDDAP" button and "copy as cURL" the link that looks like:
<br>  <kbd>login.html</kbd>
<br>and paste this third curl command into the text file.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> In the text file, you will now have 3 lines like the following, 
where you have logged into an ERDDAP™ server at '<i>https://host.somewhere.com/erddap</i>'.  
The first curl command gets your user profile in "login_hint" and generates an "id_token".  
The second uses the id_token to log into Google, and the third then logs in to ERDDAP.

<p><textarea rows="22" cols="80">
curl 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframerpc?action=issueToken&amp;response_type=token%20id_token&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20email&amp;client_id=ABCDEFG.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;login_hint=XXXXXXXXXX&amp;ss_domain=https%3A%2F%2Fhost.somewhere.com&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fhost.somewhere.com' --2.0 -H 'Host: accounts.google.com' -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframe' -H 'Cookie: lotsofcookiestuff' -H 'Connection: keep-alive'

curl 'https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/loginGoogle.html' -H 'Host: host.somewhere.com' -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/login.html' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Cookie: cookiestuff' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --data 'idtoken=HUGELONGIDTOKEN'

curl 'https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/login.html' -H 'Host: host.somewhere.com' -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: typeacceptstuff' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/login.html' -H 'Cookie: cookiestuff' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1'
</textarea>



<li> The above 3 lines, when run sequentially from a command line, will log you
into ERDDAP.  In order to use these in a script you need to capture the id_token
from the first line, feed it to the second line, and write a cookie to be read 
by subsequent lines.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li> To develop a script, run the first ('https://accounts.google.com) 
curl line exactly as it was copied from the developer tools, and capture the response 
(you may get a curl error about the flag "--2.0" just remove it). 
In php it looks like the following:

<p><textarea rows="16" cols="80">
$gcurlstuff="curl 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframerpc?action=issueToken&amp;response_type=token%20id_token&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20email&amp;client_id=ABCDEFG.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;login_hint=XXXXXXXXXX&amp;ss_domain=https%3A%2F%2Fhost.somewhere.com&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fhost.somewhere.com' -H 'Host: accounts.google.com' -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframe' -H 'Cookie: lotsofcookiestuff' -H 'Connection: keep-alive'";

//execute the curl command:
exec($gcurlstuff,$output,$status);
//the response is a json array in $output
$response=json_decode($output[0],true);
//the part you need is in "id_token":
$id_token=$response["id_token"];
</textarea>

<p>Log in to Google by executing the second line using $id_token, first removing the 
"-H 'Cookie: stuff'" parameter and instead telling curl to write a cookie:

<p><textarea rows="9" cols="80">
$glcurlstuff="curl 'https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/loginGoogle.html' -H 'Host: host.somewhere.com' -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/login.html' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Cookie: cookiestuff' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --data 'idtoken=".$id_token."' -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt"

exec($glcurlstuff,$output1,$status);
</textarea>

<p>Log in to ERDDAP™, again removing the "-H 'Cookie: stuff'" parameter, and 
using the previously written cookie:

<p><textarea rows="8" cols="80">
$ecurlstuff="curl 'https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/login.html' -H 'Host: host.somewhere.com' -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: typeacceptstuff' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/login.html' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 -b cookies.txt"'

exec($ecurlstuff,$output2,$status);
</textarea>

<p>You should now be able to request data from the server, using the same cookie:

<p><textarea rows="9" cols="80">
$curlstuff="curl -s 'https://host.somewhere.com/erddap/tabledap/datasetid.csv?variablelist' -H 'Host: host.somewhere.com'  -H 'User-Agent: useragentstuff' -H 'Accept: typeacceptstuff' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1'  -b cookies.txt";

exec($curlstuff,$output3,$status);
//$output3 will be data in csv!
</textarea>

</ol>
