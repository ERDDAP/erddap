			   JPlotPane Notes

			      11/30/2000

* Create JPlotPane
  1) create and initealizes managers. (Print, DnD, Layer, ...)
  2) other initialization efforts.
  3) clear pane?

* addData(SGTData, PlotLayerHints) to JPlotPane
  1) create PlotLayer (data, hints)
     - create Graph
     - create Renderer and bind data
  2) invoke PlotLayerManager
      as newLayer(PlotLayer) or reLayout() <-  is this needed?

      - if newLayer
	+ get X-Y types (space/time, units)
	+ using hints match with existing LayerStack
	+ if needed create new LayerStack & add to JPlotPane
	  else find stack to add layer to...
	+ create new transform if needed or bind to existing transform
	+ create new axes if needed

      - if modified Layer
	+ check for X-Y axes owner
	+ check for transforms
	+ update Key
	  (once a PlotLayer is assigned to a LayerStack it
	   stays there unless explictly moved)

* hints (should hints include values?)
  1) Keys  (location- on layer, new layer, table, popup; position)
  2) Transforms (scale/offset, share, new)
  3) Axes (share, new, location)
  4) PlotLayer ...

* modes
  1) Zoom
  2) Object Select
  3) Data Select
  4) Layer DnD (LayerStack is DnD client/server?)
  5) Default (none? Zoom?)


* LayerManager
  1) LayerManager should have its rules about what can be overlayed!
     For example, raster grid should not be over a contour grid! 
  2) LayerManager should be able to re-order the Layers in a
     LayerStack?
