Property dialogs for <code>sgt</code> components using 
<code>javax.swing</code>.  Dialogs that edit the properties of
attributes and other <code>sgt</code> objects do not, in general, work
on a copy of the object.  Because the references to attributes are
one-way if a copy were created the editing would not affect most of
the references. If you want these dialogs to work on copies instead of
the actual object, the creation of the copy and updating of the
original, if the changes are applied, will need to be done in the
users application.
