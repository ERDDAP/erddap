This assumes that there are the same number of profiles for all
trajectories, and the same number of vertical level for every profile.

Use case:

Unlimited Dimension:
   Any of the three dimensions (profile, trajectory, or z) can be the
   NetCDF unlimited dimension if it might be useful to enlarge it.
   One must know the maximum size of the non-unlimited dimensions before file creation.
