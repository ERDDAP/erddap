All of the 'stations' in this file need to have the same 'time' values (they share the 'time'
variable as a dimension).  This means that each of the wind sensors would need to be taking
measurements at exactly the same time.  While rather unlikely, some post-processing of data
will normalize measurements to the even minute and this format might be useful.
