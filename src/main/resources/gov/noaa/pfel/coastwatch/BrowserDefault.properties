# BrowserDefault.properties contains default setup information for all Browser subclasses.
# Properties files have info in the form: name = value
# Spaces before and after the "=" are ignored.
# Backslash, \, can be used at the end of a line in a .properties
#   file to indicate that the logical line is continued on the next physical line.
# The formfeed character, \f, is also often used as a separator.
# Sometimes the left single quote character, `, is used as a lower-level separator 
#   when a tab might be used in a Unix document. But tabs are hard to work with
#   since you can't actually see them.
# Lines starting with "#" are comments.
