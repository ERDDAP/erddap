			    Release Notes

$Id: RELEASE-NOTES-2.1.txt,v 1.2 2001/12/14 01:08:02 dwd Exp $

Introduction:
-------------

This document describes the changes in the Scientific Graphics Toolkit
from version 2.0 to 2.1. 

Bug reports, comments, and suggestions can be sent to
dwd@pmel.noaa.gov or sgt@epic.noaa.gov.

New Features:
-------------

Two major new features have been added to SGT since its last
release. Both features require Java2D, which is available in JDK
version 1.2 and newer.

Vectors. The datatype SGTVector has been implemented and the
    VectorAttribute, VectorKey, VectorCartesianRenderer, and
    VectorAttributeDialog classes have been added to support vector
    drawing.  The VectorAttribute class enables users to customize
    vector head attributes (e.g. scale, min and max head size), color,
    line attributes (width, cap and miter style), and optionally
    placing a plot mark at the vector origin.  See the javadoc for
    more information.

    JPlotLayout has been expanded to include support for the
    SGTVector datatype.

Stroke lines.  Stroke lines, where the width, dash properties, cap and
    miter styles, are all selectable have been added.  Line and
    contour plotting now make use of the new stroke lines.

Line key title.  To better support dynamic changes in data a SGLabel
    can be specified to describe a data object in a LineKey,
    PointCollectionKey, and VectorKey.  This feature was added so that
    the key could be automatically updated when the data changed.

GridAttributeDialog, LineAttributeDialog, PointAttributeDialog, and
    VectorAttributeDialog now allow multiple JPanes to be registered.
    This enables the dialog to notifiy both the main graphic JPane and
    a JPane that contains a key that attribute changes have occured.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:
---------------------------

A bug that required a Graphics object to be available before
setBatch(false) could be called has been fixed. This feature uses the
new init() method that is available in Pane and JPane.  The init()
method is called with the Pane or JPane first becomes visible,
initializing those features that require a Graphics object reference. 

Several bugs have been fixed in JPlotLayout, relating to LineKey
placement, and using the new init() method.

Known Issues This Release:
--------------------------

GridAttributeDialog is still not complete.  It presently only works
with an IndexedColorMap.

Java2D is required for the new Stroke lines and Vector graphics to
work.
