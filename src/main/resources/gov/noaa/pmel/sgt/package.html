Core classes for the Scientific Graphics Toolkit.

<P>The Java Scientific Graphics Toolkit (<CODE>sgt</CODE>) is designed
to allow a graphics client developer a great deal of flexibility and
freedom. <CODE>sgt</CODE> is a package that greatly aids a developer
in creating graphics applets. <CODE>sgt</CODE> is not a general
purpose graphics package, but provides the tools to enable scientific
graphics to be easily incorporated into applications or
<code>Applets</code>.</P>

<P>SGT has three main components, the <CODE>JPane</CODE>, on which all
graphics are drawn. The <CODE>Layer</CODE>, of which several can be
associated with a single <CODE>JPane</CODE>, that insulates the
developer from device coordinates.  And the <CODE>Graph</CODE>, of
which a single instance can be associated with a <CODE>Layer</CODE>,
that transforms form user coordinates (e.g. cm/sec, time, etc) to the
layer coordinate system (physical coordinates).

<P>Examples demonstrating the use of SGT are available in the {@link
gov.noaa.pmel.sgt.demo demo} package.  These examples show how to
create SGT applications from scratch and how to use the {@link
gov.noaa.pmel.sgt.swing.JPlotLayout JPlotLayout} utility class.  A <A

</A> on using SGT to develop interactive graphics is now available.
