This is the set up file for a NetCheck installation. 

NetCheck is a program which periodically does functional tests of network 
resources and sends emails to various subscribers whenever there is a change
in the status of a test (when a test initially fails, or when the nature of
the failure changes, or when a test that had been failing now passes). 
Currently, NetCheck can run three types of tests:
  * HttpTest tests if the content retrieved from a URL includes various desired
    text strings and doesn't include various undesired text strings.
  * SftpTest tests if a file can be uploaded to another computer, renamed, and 
    downloaded via sftp.
  * OpendapTest tests if information can be obtained from a gridded data file 
    served by OPeNDAP. 

Installation:
  * Because NetCheck is designed to test the availability of network resources,
    it should be installed on a computer other than the computers providing
    the services you want to test. Also, it should be on a computer that can
    be left on all of the time so that NetCheck can do its tests day and night.
    Ideally, it should be on the computer with the best battery backup, so
    that it is the least likely to have trouble if the power goes out for a
    while.

What you need to do:
  * Modify this file so that it does the tests you want to do.
    * Like other XML files, this file contains information stored in a
      hierarchy of XML start tags (for example, "<setup>") and XML end tags 
      (for example, "</setup>"). At the lowest levels, values are stored
      between the start and end tags (for example, 
      "<minutesBetweenTests>5</minutesBetweenTests>".
    * There are comments throughout this file to help you figure things out.
    * When modifying this file, you may:
      * Change some of the values between existing tags.
      * Delete some of the tags (for example, you may not want to 
        emailPeriodicHeadlines to anyone).
      * Make copies of some of the tags, including all of the enclosed tags
        (for example, you may want to set up more than one httpTest).
    * If you just want to see if things work, here is a minimalist approach:
      * Enter the email server information for all of the <setup><smtpXxx> tags.
        Use the information you used when you set up your email client program.
      * Save your changes and try to run "NetCheck -testmode" (see below).
        * When you are prompted for the email password, enter the password
          for your email account.
        * When you are prompted for the password for the sftp test,
          enter any text. The resulting test will fail, but you'll get
          to see a test fail.
  * Run NetCheck.bat (for Windows) or NetCheck (for Unix/Linux/Mac) 
    from a command-line window.
    * On Unix/Linux/Mac, to make the NetCheck shell script executable, type 
      "chmod +x NetCheck" at the command line.
    * NetCheck requires a modern version of Java. It has been tested with
      a couple of versions of 1.5.x, but should work with earlier versions
      (like 1.4.x). Java versions before 1.5 had a security problem,
      so it is best to have at least Java 1.5.0.
    * If anything in this XML file is not valid, NetCheck will display
      an error message and stop.
    * NetCheck will run forever (until you press Ctrl-C or the computer 
      crashes). It is good to let NetCheck run day and night, monitoring 
      your network and sending emails to various subscribers whenever there 
      is a change in the status of a test. So, it is best to lock your computer
      (with the Windows-L key combination on Windows computers), 
      not put the computer to sleep or turn the computer off.
    * Log File: NetCheck will create a log file in the same directory and with 
      the same name as this .xml file, but will the additional extension .log,
      for example, C:\Program Files\netcheck\NetCheck.xml.log .
    * If you include "-testmode" on the command line, NetCheck will send
      an email to the system administrator showing the results of all of 
      the tests each time the tests are done, and will not send emails to
      any one else for any reason.

External Testing: 
If NetCheck is run from a computer at the same site as many of the 
computers it is testing, it is also good to have some way to check that 
your site is available from external locations. Ideally, you would run
NetCheck at some remote site, but that makes it harder to administer and
may be difficult to arrange. Instead, you can use a simple service like 
the service offered by http://www.siteuptime.com to ping your site 
periodically and make sure it is still accessible from outside of your site.

New version of NetCheck:
If you install a new version of NetCheck, be sure to save this .xml file
temporarily with a different name or in a different directory so that the
standard .xml file in the new version of NetCheck won't overwrite your
.xml file. After installation, rename the standard .xml file (so you can
read the comments in it) and rename your .xml file to its original name.
