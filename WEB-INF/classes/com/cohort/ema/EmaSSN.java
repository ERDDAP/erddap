/**
 * This class holds the properties for displaying a United States-style 
 * Social Security Number in the format "###-##-####".
 *
 * <p>The supported properties in the className+".properties" file are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> name+".doubleWide" ("true" or "false") 
 *     indicates if this attribute should be displayed
 *     in wide format (spanning two columns in the HTML table),
 *     or standard format (label in the left column, component in the right).
 * <li> name+".required" ("true" or "false", default = true) 
 *     indicates if a value must be provided for this attribute
 *     to be considered valid. If false, a value of "" is considered valid.
 * <li> name+".label" (an HTML text string, 
 *      default = "Social Security Number:")
 *      is the label on the HTML form
 * <li> name+".title" (a plain text String, 
 *      default = "The SSN must have the format \"###-##-####\".") 
 *      is the toolTip for this attribute.
 *      The title is also used as the error message if the value is invalid.
 * <li> name+".value" is the value for the SSN (which must be in the
 *    form "###-##-####") stored by this object
 * <li> name+".submitOnEnter" ("true" or "false", default = "false"),
 *     specifies if the HTML form should be submitted if the
 *     user presses Enter in the HTML textfield.
 *     If this is false, the JavaScript script in EmaClass.IncludeJavaScript 
 *     must be in the "head" section of the HTML page
 *     that contains the HTML form.
 * <li> This class automatically sets the size, maxlength, and
 *      regex properties inherited from EmaString.
 * </ul>
 *
