/** Represents a sub-clause of the selection portion of a constraint 
 *  expression. A sub-clause is any part of a constraint that
 *  can be evaluated to a BaseType value. For instance, the constraint
 *  "var1>=function(var2,var3)" would have sub clauses "var1" and 
 *  "function(var2,var3)". The latter would in turn have the sub-clauses
 *  "var2" and "var3".  <p>
 * 
 *  A given instance of SubClause may change the value it returns when 
 *  evaluated multiple times, but should not change the class of BaseType 
 *  it returns. This allows function and operator clauses to do type-checking
 *  using the getValue() method.
 * 
 *  The parser supports several kinds of sub-clause. These are described
 *  in the ClauseFactory interface.
 *  See CEEValuator for an explanation of how Clauses are evaluated on 
 *    data.
