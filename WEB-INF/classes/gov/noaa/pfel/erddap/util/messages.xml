<!-- messages.xml contains text messages for ERDDAP (which are read in EDStatic).
When you install ERDDAP on your server, all of these messages can be left as is,
since these messages are usually the same at different ERDDAP installations.
Or, you can customize ERDDAP by changing these messages.
Or, you can translate these messages into other languages (e.g., Spanish).

VERY IMPORTANT:

One line?
If the English message appears as one long line (with no newlines), please make the 
translation one line line also.

HTML or Not?
If the English message has HTML tags, then it is safe to use HTML tags; otherwise, it isn't.
If the message uses HTML tags, please use the same tags in the translation.

MessageFormat Placeholders
Many messages use Java MessageFormat-style substitution placeholders like {0} and {1}.

<&headingType;><a class="selfLink" id="compression" href="#compression" rel="bookmark">Requesting Compressed Files</a></&headingType;> 
ERDDAP doesn't offer results stored in compressed (e.g., .zip or .gzip) files.
Instead, ERDDAP looks for
<a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/">accept-encoding&externalLinkHtml;</a>
in the HTTP GET request header sent
by the client.  If a supported compression type ("gzip", "x-gzip", or "deflate") is found
in the accept-encoding list, ERDDAP includes "content&#8209;encoding" in the HTTP response
header and compresses the data as it transmits it.
It is up to the client program to look for "content-encoding" and decompress the data accordingly.
Requesting compression is optional, but compressed responses are often 3-10 times faster,
so this is a big time savings if you are downloading lots of large files.
(Note that there is no benefit
to requesting compressed .png files since the files' contents are already compressed.)
<ul>
<li>By default, browsers and OPeNDAP clients always request compressed data and
  decompress the returned data.
<li>With curl, add <kbd>--compressed</kbd> to the command line to tell curl to
  request a compressed response and automatically decompress it.
<li>With other client software, you have explicitly set this up.
  <br>Here is a 
  <a href="https://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-HttpUrlConnection-with-GZIP-encoding.html">Java example&externalLinkHtml;</a>.
  <br>Here is a 
  <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/eyadkg/http-request-response-with-compressed-body-in-python">Python example&externalLinkHtml;</a>
  (although you should either handle "deflate"'d responses or not request "deflate").

<!-- This is a description of Advanced Search. -->
<advancedSearchTooltip><![CDATA[
Advanced Search combines all of the search techniques
and adds searches for datasets that have data within longitude, latitude, and time ranges,
so you can search for datasets based on many different criteria simultaneously.

<advancedSearchCategoryTooltip><![CDATA[
Datasets can be categorized in different ways
based on the values of various metadata attributes.
<p>Most datasets have multiple values for some attributes,
for example, the "long_name" associated with each variable.
To search for more than one value, enter additional values in the Full Text
text field above, e.g., <kbd>"long_name=Sea Surface Temperature"</kbd>.
]]></advancedSearchCategoryTooltip>

<advancedSearchRangeTooltip><![CDATA[
Datasets will match these criteria if they have a least some matching data.
<p>All grid datasets that have longitude, latitude and time variables
<br>have the data-range information needed to do these tests.
<br>Unfortunately, some tabular datasets have the variables, but don't have
<br>the data-range information. They will be excluded from the search results.
]]></advancedSearchRangeTooltip>

<advancedSearchMapTooltip><![CDATA[
This is optional.
<br>You can specify longitude and latitude bounds by entering text in the text fields,
<br>or you can specify a rectangle on the map by clicking on two diagonal corners.
<br>(To change the rectangle, click on the new corners.)
<br>Drawing a rectangle on the map automatically puts values in the longitude and 
<br>latitude text fields. 
<br>The values in the longitude and latitude text fields are what really count.
<br>Drawing a rectangle on the map is just an easy way to specify those values.
]]></advancedSearchMapTooltip>

<advancedSearchLonTooltip><![CDATA[
<p>Some datasets have longitude values within -180 to 180, others use 0 to 360.
<br>If you specify Min and Max Longitude within -180 to 180 (or 0 to 360),
<br>ERDDAP will only find datasets that match the values you specify.
<br>Consider doing one search: longitude -180 to 360,
<br>or two searches: longitude -180 to 180, and 0 to 360.

<li>Enter a time string with the format yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ, 
  <br>for example, 2009-01-21T23:00:00Z.

  <br>You can omit (backwards from the end) Z, :ss, :mm, :HH, and T.
  <br>Always use UTC (GMT/Zulu) time.

<convertTimeIntro><![CDATA[
In various places in ERDDAP, a point in time can be represented as either: 
<ul>
<li><strong>A String</strong> -
  ERDDAP always uses the 
  <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"
  >ISO 8601:2004 "extended" format<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"

  <span class="nowrap">yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ</span> - for example,
  <span class="nowrap">2018-01-02T00:00:00Z</span> .
  Datasets outside of ERDDAP often use a different format for string time values.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><strong>A Number</strong> - 
  When representing times as numbers, ERDDAP always writes a 
  <span class="N"><a rel="bookmark" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/"
  >UDUNITS-compatible number<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a></span>
  - for example, <span class="N">n=473472000 units="seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".</span>
  ERDDAP uses that exact units string for all datasets.
  Data sets outside of ERDDAP often use different units strings.
</ul>
This web page has converters that can change string time values (with various formats)
to/from numeric time values (with various units strings).
It also has converters to change time strings and units strings that use 
other formats into the formats used by ERDDAP. 

<p>To avoid time zone and daylight saving time confusion,
time values in ERDDAP always use the Zulu (UTC, GMT) time zone, denoted by 'Z'.
The converters below accept string times with other time zones.

<br>&nbsp;

<li><a class="selfLink" id="goal" href="#goal" rel="help">Goal</a> - An underlying goal for ERDDAP''s system for dealing with time is 
to have a single
system that allows time data from any dataset to be compared directly to time data from
any other dataset. Please keep that in mind when you read the other comments below.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><a class="selfLink" id="timePoints" href="#timePoints" rel="help">Time Points</a> - 
ERDDAP only deals with time points (a combined
date+time in the 
Zulu time zone, each an instant in time).
<br>&nbsp;

<li><a class="selfLink" id="timeZones" href="#timeZones" rel="help">Time Zones</a> - 
When writing time values, ERDDAP always uses the Zulu (UTC, GMT)
time zone and never uses daylight saving times.  Time data from a source with 
time zone information (which may incorporate daylight saving time information) 
is converted to Zulu time. Time data from a source without time zone information 
is assumed to be already in Zulu time.
<br>&nbsp;
  
<li><a class="selfLink" id="precision" href="#precision" rel="help">Precision</a> - 
ERDDAP deals with time internally as 
"seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z", 
ignoring <a rel="help" href="#leapSeconds">leap seconds</a>, stored as double precision floating point numbers. Thus,
most time data can be stored very precisely (roughly to the nearest microsecond,
but progressively less precisely very far in the past or future).  

<p>When doing calculations, ERDDAP often works to the nearest millisecond, to 
avoid problems with floating point numbers that are slightly more or less 
than you expect.

<p>When representing times as numbers, ERDDAP always leaves the numbers at their full
precision.

<p>By default, when representing times as Strings, ERDDAP formats times to the 
(truncated) second (i.e., omitting millis). However, ERDDAP administrators can
configure specific variables in specific datasets to represent String times at 
other precisions (e.g., from millisecond precision up to month precision; see the 
&lt;time_precision&gt; variable attribute).  Whenever a time field (e.g., milliseconds
or seconds) is not shown, the absent value is assumed to be 0 (except for 
day-of-month, which is assumed to be 1).

<li><a class="selfLink" id="consistentUnits" href="#consistentUnits" rel="help">Consistent Units</a> - Using the same units for time
("seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z")
for all datasets allows times from different datasets to be compared easily. 
Seconds are the

>International System of Units (SI)<img

    base unit of time.
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z is the start of the Unix epoch, which is widely used by computer 
operating systems.  "seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z" are widely used and are 
often called
<a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
    or epoch seconds.  The use of the units string 
"seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z" makes Unix time compatible with
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/"

    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>,
    which uses UDUNITS for units 
definitions.
<br>&nbsp;
  
<li><a class="selfLink" id="textRepresentation" href="#textRepresentation" rel="help">Text Representation</a> - By default, when formatting times as
    text, ERDDAP uses the 
<a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"
>ISO 8601:2004 "extended" format String<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>, 
    truncated to the second 
(e.g., 2011-04-26T14:07:12Z).  (Related humor: 
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">https://xkcd.com/1179/<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>)
ERDDAP administrators can configure a given variable to display the time data values
to greater precision (truncated to 0.001 second, 0.01 second, 0.1 second)
or to lesser precision (truncated to second, minute, hour, date, or month)
to indicate the precision of the time data values.  

<p>When reading ISO 8601 times with decimal seconds, ERDDAP accepts a period separator
(e.g., 2011-04-26T14:07:12.059Z) or a comma separator (e.g., 2011-04-26T14:07:12,059Z).
Currently, when writing ISO 8601 times ERDDAP always uses a period separator.
  
<li><a class="selfLink" id="gregorianCalendar" href="#gregorianCalendar" rel="help"
>Gregorian Calendar</a> -
ERDDAP uses the Gregorian Calendar for times after the
discontinuity in 1582 and the Julian calendar for times before the discontinuity.
(The ISO 8601:2004 standard doesn''t specify how to handle times before 1582.)
See the
<a rel="help" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html"
>Java GregorianCalendar class<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
    (which ERDDAP uses) for details.
For example, 17611992 hours since 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z = 2010-03-01T00:00:00Z
(<a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=17611992&amp;units=hours%20since%200001-01-01T00:00:00Z">see for yourself</a>)

<p>Currently, ERDDAP does not support any other calendar (including the noleap, 365_day,
360_day, and Julian calendars defined by the
<a rel="help" href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html#calendar"
>CF metadata conventions<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>).  
However, you can store such data in ERDDAP by storing the numbers or 
Strings in a variable that is
named something other than "time" and doesn''t include "since" in the units metadata.
Then, ERDDAP won''t interpret the values as times and won''t convert the data to 
"seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z". Users will be able to access the data in its 
original form.

<li><a class="selfLink" id="lenient" href="#lenient" rel="help">Lenient</a> - 
ERDDAP is "lenient" when it parses date/time strings. That means
that date/times with the correct format, but with month, date, hour, minute,
and/or second values that are too large or too small will be rolled to the
appropriate date/times.  For example, ERDDAP interprets 2001-12-32 as
2002-01-01, and interprets 2002-01-00 as 2001-12-31.
(It''s not a bug, it''s a feature! We understand that you may object to this
if you are not familiar with lenient parsing. We understand there are 
circumstances where some people would prefer strict parsing, but there are also
circumstances where some people would prefer lenient parsing. ERDDAP can''t
have it both ways. This was a conscious choice. Lenient parsing is the default 
behavior in Java, the language that ERDDAP is written in and arguably the 
most-used computer language. Also, this behavior is consistent with ERDDAP''s 
conversion of requested grid axis values to the nearest valid grid axis value.
And this is consistent with some other places in ERDDAP that try to repair
invalid input when the intention is clear, instead of just returning an error
message.)
<br>&nbsp;

<li><a class="selfLink" id="BCE" href="#BCE" rel="help">BCE</a> <a class="selfLink" id="BC" href="#BC" rel="help">(BC)</a> Years and Astronomical Year Numbering - 
As specified in the ISO 8601:2004 standard, ERDDAP just uses the Common
Era (CE, AD) for year numbers, not BCE. For years before 1 CE, historians
use the BCE or BC designation and no year 0, so their sequence of years near
the era transition is 2 BCE, 1 BCE, 1 CE, 2 CE.  For years before 1 BCE, the
ISO 8601:2004 standard (according to my reading of it) 
encourages the use of a different system:
<a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering"
    >Astronomical Year Numbering<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>,
    in which 1 BC is called year 0000, 2 BC is 
called year -0001, etc. Since Astronomical Year Numbering is encouraged by
ISO 8601:2004 and used by many scientific fields, and because oceanographers 
and climatologists often use year 0000 for climatologies, ERDDAP uses 
Astronomical Year Numbering. Thus, the years near the era transition in 
ERDDAP are -0001, 0000, 0001, 0002, respectively. Thus, for BCE years:
AstronomicalYear = 1 - BCEYear (see for yourself:
      <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=-1&amp;units=days%20since%200001-01-01">test1</a>, 
      <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=1985&amp;units=years%20since%200000-01-01">test2</a> and
      <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=-2&amp;units=years%20since%200000-01-01">test3</a>).
An advantage of Astronomical Year Numbering is that all leap years are 
divisible by 4, e.g., ..., -0008, -0004, 0000, 0004, 0008, .... 
If you remember to use Astronomical Year Numbers, ERDDAP will work for

    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"

    time system. UTC is the modern version of the GMT 
time system.  UTC uses occasional leap seconds to stay close to the International Atomic
Time (TAI). GPS devices use GPS time (which doesn''t use leap seconds) internally,
but display UTC time to users. (See 
    <a rel="help" href="https://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html"

    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
    or other 
discussions of Systems of Time.) Strictly speaking, UTC can''t be used in some
situations for far future times (e.g., in models), since the occurrence of leap
seconds can''t be predicted. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><a class="selfLink" id="leapSeconds" href="#leapSeconds" rel="help">Leap Seconds</a> - 
Like Unix time and UDUNITS, ERDDAP''s 
"seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z" is a numeric encoding (which doesn''t use leap
seconds) of UTC time (which does use leap seconds). When converting string times 
to/from numeric times, ERDDAP, like Unix time and UDUNITS, ignores leap seconds. 
Yet, ERDDAP, Unix time, and UDUNITS numeric times all say they use UTC.  
Here''s why and how:
Since computer clocks are not good timekeepers, they drift from UTC time and have
to be reset to UTC time occasionally. Unix time treats leap seconds as part of the time
deviation caused by the clock''s drift. This allows software to do time encoding and
time calculations and ignore leap seconds.  With ERDDAP, Unix time, and UDUNITS
numeric time values, all minutes are treated as having 60 seconds, even though UTC
minutes with leap seconds have 61 seconds.  Note that database programs like

    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
(and so probably MariaDB also),

>C#<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
also basically try to ignore leap seconds.
This won''t cause problems when converting UTC String date+time+timeZone values into
ERDDAP numeric values if the times are then reconverted back to date+time+Zulu
Strings in a way that also ignores leap seconds. The two errors will cancel each
other out. One unfortunate consequence is that ERDDAP, Unix time, and UDUNITS
numeric times have no mechanism to encode actual leap seconds as numbers
unambiguously. For example, both the leap second
<a href="{0}/convert/time.html?isoTime=2008-12-31T23%3A59%3A60Z&amp;units=seconds+since+1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z">2008-12-31T23:59:60Z</a> 
and the next second
<a href="{0}/convert/time.html?isoTime=2009-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z&amp;units=seconds+since+1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z"
>2009-01-01T00:00:00Z</a> are encoded as 
1230768000 seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.  This is a flaw, but only affects
actual leap seconds. Similarly, if you need to calculate the exact number of UTC
seconds between two points in time, you can use ERDDAP to handle the time data,
but subtracting one numeric time value from the other is just the first step in
the calculation.  You need to manually adjust that value by consulting a

<li><a class="selfLink" id="lowResolutionTimes" href="#lowResolutionTimes" rel="help"
>Low Resolution Times and Time Spans (Time Ranges)</a> - 
If time data was recorded to
a lower resolution (e.g., a minute, hour, day, month, or year) or represents a time
span (e.g., a specific hour, day, 7-day period, month, year), ERDDAP requires that
a time point (we call it the "nominal time") be used to represent that time or time
span. Using a nominal time allows time points, low resolution time points, and time
spans to be interoperable. (Imagine visualizing different datasets in a program like 
Google Earth and using a time slider to control which subset of data is visible.) 
The most commonly selected time points for the nominal time are the start time and 
the centered time (less common, but has advantages for use with time sliders). We 
recommend that you use the long_name metadata to identify this (e.g., "Start Time" or 
"Centered Time"). For low resolution times, consider e.g., "Date", "Month", and "Year".
And/or, put the details in the variable''s "comment" metadata.

<p>Or, to more accurately represent time spans, you can set up a dataset to have both 
a beginTime and an endTime variable (and even a centeredTime, if you want
to cover all possibilities).

order out of the time format chaos, deals reasonably well with most

currently.

For example, "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".
The first word can be (upper or lowercase):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;ms, msec, msecs, millis, millisecond, milliseconds,

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;week, weeks,

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;yr, yrs, year, or years.
<p>"since" is required.
<p>So another example is "hours since 0001-01-01".
<p>The time string can be in any format. The date part is required. The time part is optional. ERDDAP will do its best to read the format that you provide.
The recommended format is the ISO 8601:2004 "extended" format yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ,
where Z is 'Z' or a &plusmn;hh or &plusmn;hh:mm offset from the Zulu/GMT time zone.
If you omit Z and the offset, the Zulu/GMT time zone is used.
Separately, if you omit .SSS, :ss.SSS, :mm:ss.SSS, or Thh:mm:ss.SSS, the
missing fields are assumed to be 0. 
<p>Technically, ERDDAP does NOT follow the UDUNITS standard when converting "years since"
and "months since" time values to "seconds since". The UDUNITS standard defines a
year as a fixed, single value: 3.15569259747e7 seconds. And UDUNITS defines a month
as year/12. Unfortunately, most/all datasets that we have seen that use 
"years since" or "months since" clearly intend the values to be calendar years
or calendar months. For example, 3 "months since 1970-01-01" is usually intended
to mean 1970-04-01. So, ERDDAP interprets "years since" and "months since" as
calendar years and months, and does not strictly follow the UDUNITS standard.

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="unitsFilter" href="#unitsFilter" rel="help">Requesting UDUNITS or UCUM Units from Tabledap</a></h2>
When you request data or a graph from a
<a href="{0}/tabledap/index.html">tabledap dataset</a>,
you can request that the units
be described via UDUNITS by appending <kbd>&amp;units("UDUNITS")</kbd> at the end of the request.
Or, you can request that the units be described via UCUM by appending <kbd>&amp;units("UCUM")</kbd>.
(For details, see the
<a rel="help" href="{0}/tabledap/documentation.html#functions">tabledap documentation</a>.)
On this ERDDAP, the default for most/all datasets is {1}.

<ul>
<li>Always check the results from the converters.
<li>This isn't a validator. 
  If the UDUNITS or UCUM units string is valid, the converter should return
  a correct, valid, converted string. 
  If the UDUNITS (or UCUM) units string isn't valid, the converter will do its best
  and won't generate an error message. 
  Invalid and unrecognized UDUNITS (or UCUM) names will be passed through unchanged.
  Emphasis is placed on preserving information rather than sanitizing or validating
  the units strings.
<li>The UDUNITS to UCUM converter can convert all UDUNITS-1 units Strings and most of UDUNITS-2.
<li>The UCUM to UDUNITS converter can convert almost all case-sensitive UCUM units Strings.
<li>For conversions in either direction, 
  the results will be standardized in the sense that 
  slight variations in the aliases and the syntax of the input will result in 
  the same output. For example,
  UDUNITS="meter per second", "meters/second", "m.s^-1", and "m s-1" will all
  return UCUM="m.s-1".  There is nothing special, unique, or better
  about the specific aliases or syntax of the standardized output
  compared to other aliases or syntax, except that is similar to the
  "canonical" form returned by the UDUNITS software. 
<li>The "Standardize UDUNITS" option works well for valid UDUNITS strings 
  and reasonably well for non-standard / invalid UDUNITS strings.
  Note that this is a simple standardization 
  (e.g., "joule", "joules", and "J" all return "J")
  as opposed to the "canonical" form offered by the UDUNITS software 
  (which, for example, converts all of the joule aliases to "kg.m2.s-2").
<li>If you think that a converter did a conversion incorrectly,
  first make sure that the input string is valid.
  If you think the input string is valid,
  please email the details to <kbd>bob dot simons at noaa dot gov</kbd> .

<EDDTableFromEDDGridSummary>
NOTE: This dataset is the tabular version of a gridded dataset which is also
available in this ERDDAP (see datasetID={0}). Most people, most
of the time, will prefer to use the original gridded version of this dataset.
This dataset presents all of the axisVariables and dataVariables from the
gridded dataset as columns in a huge database-like table of data.
You can query this dataset as you would any other tabular dataset in ERDDAP;
however, if you query any of the original dataVariables, you must constrain
what was axisVariable[0] (usually "time") so that data for no more than {1}
axisVariable[0] values are searched.

<filesDocumentation><![CDATA[
ERDDAP's "files" system lets you browse a virtual file system and download 
source
data files. Hopefully, this is a familiar, easy system that you can use with your
favorite web browser or, if you prefer, from a command line program like 
<a rel="help" href="#curl">curl</a>.

<p>ERDDAP was designed around the idea that most datasets are huge, so most users
just need or want a subset of the dataset that they are interested in 
(e.g., a smaller geographic area, a smaller time range, or not all of the data variables). 
But we 
understand that some users actually do want an entire dataset, or at least the subset
which is found in a subset of the source data files.  If that's you, then the "files"
system may be for you. One advantage of the "files" system is that you can see each
file's size (in bytes) and Last Modified time (Zulu time zone), 
so it is easy to see if a file has been changed.

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="Click" href="#Click" rel="bookmark">Click</a></h3>
To use the "files" system, just click. On any "files" web page, you can:
<ul>
<li>Click on a heading (Name, Last modified, Size, or Description) to sort the items
  by that attribute. Clicking repeatedly on one heading toggles the sort order 
  (ascending or descending).  Note that "Last modified" uses the Zulu time zone.
<li>Click on a directory name to go to that directory. 
<li>Click on a filename to download that file.
  <br>&nbsp;
</ul>

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="warning" href="#warning" rel="help"><span class="warningColor">WARNING!</span> Different Metadata and Variable Names</a></h3>
For datasets available via ERDDAP's tabledap or griddap, ERDDAP administrators
can set up ERDDAP to change a dataset's metadata and variable names on-the-fly 
so that you, the user, see an improved version of the dataset's metadata. But in
"files", you will see the original metadata and variable names, so don't be surprised
if they are different! If you aren't comfortable dealing with the different metadata
and variable names, you might prefer using the dataset's Data Access Form instead.

<p>Similarly, when you request a subset of data from one of ERDDAP's Data Access Forms, 
you can specify the file type (e.g., .nc, .csv, .json, .mat) that you want to receive in
response. Naturally, the source data files available via "files" are just available in
one file type. If you aren't happy with the source file's file type, you might prefer
using the dataset's Data Access Forms instead.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="notAllDatasets" href="#notAllDatasets" rel="help">Not All Datasets</a></h3>
Some datasets in this ERDDAP aren't available via the "files" system. Common reasons
include:
<ul>
<li>The dataset's data doesn't come from files (e.g., it comes from a database
  or Cassandra, or from a remote ERDDAP, THREDDS, or GRADS data server).
<li>The immediate source files are .ncml files which specify how to modify the
  actual data files on-the-fly.
<li>The ERDDAP administrator chose not to make the source data files available.
</ul>
If the source files for a dataset that you want aren't available, you can email 
the administrator of this ERDDAP, &adminEmail;,
to request that they be made available, but there is usually a reason why they aren't
already available.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="notFtp" href="#notFtp" rel="help">Not FTP</a></h3>
We understand that some users might prefer that ERDDAP offer files via FTP instead
of HTTP as is done by "files". Sorry. Hopefully, you'll be able to do what you need
to do with the current "files" system.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="curl" href="#curl" rel="help">Command Line Downloads with curl</a></h3>
If you want to download a series of files from ERDDAP, you don't have to request each
file's ERDDAP URL in your browser, sitting and waiting for each file to download. 
Ways to use curl:
<ul>
<li>If you are comfortable writing computer programs (e.g., with C, Java, Python, Matlab, r),
  you can write a program with a loop that imports all of the desired data files.
<li>If you are comfortable with command line programs (just running a program, 
  or using bash or tcsh scripts in Linux or Mac OS X, or batch files in Windows), 
  you can use curl to
  save results files from ERDDAP into files on your hard drive, without using a browser 
  or writing a computer program. 
</ul>
ERDDAP+curl is amazingly powerful and allows you to 
use ERDDAP in many new ways. To install curl:
<ul>
<li>On Linux and Mac OS X, curl is probably already installed as /usr/bin/curl.
<li>On Windows, or if your computer doesn't have curl already, you need to 
  <a rel="bookmark" href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">download curl<img
    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
  and install it.  To get to a command line in Windows, click on "Start" and type 
  "cmd" into the search text field.
  ("Win32 - Generic, Win32, binary (without SSL)" worked for me in Windows 7.)
</ul>
<strong>Please be kind to other ERDDAP users: run just one script or curl command at a time.</strong>

<p>Instructions for using curl are on the 
<a rel="help" href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">curl man page<img
    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"

<a rel="help" href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html">curl tutorial<img
    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>.
But here is a quick tutorial related to using curl with ERDDAP:
<ul>
<li>To download and save one file, use 
  <br><kbd>curl --compressed -g "<i>erddapUrl</i>" -o <i>fileDir/fileName.ext</i></kbd>
  <br>where <kbd>--compressed</kbd> tells curl to request a compressed response and automatically decompress it,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>-g</kbd> disables curl's globbing feature,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd><i>erddapUrl</i></kbd> is any ERDDAP URL that requests a data or image file, and
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>-o <i>fileDir/fileName.ext</i></kbd> specifies the name for the file that will be created.
  <br>For example,
<pre>curl --compressed -g "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/files/cwwcNDBCMet/NDBC_41004_met.nc" -o ndbc/41004.nc</pre>
In curl, as in many other programs, the query part of the erddapUrl must be 
<a class="N" rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding"
>percent encoded<img
    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>:
all characters in parameter values (the parts after '=' signs) other than A-Za-z0-9_-!.~'()*
must be encoded as %HH, where HH is the 2 digit hexadecimal value of the character, 
for example,
a space becomes %20. Characters above #127 must be converted to UTF-8 bytes, then each UTF-8
byte must be percent encoded (ask a programmer for help). There are
<a rel="help" href="https://www.url-encode-decode.com/"
>websites that percent encode and decode for you<img 
    src="../images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>. 
If you get the URL from your browser's address text field, this may be already done.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>To download and save many files in one step, use curl with the globbing feature
enabled:
<br><kbd>curl --compressed "<i>erddapUrl</i>" -o <i>fileDir/fileName#1.ext</i></kbd>
<br>Since the globbing feature treats the characters [, ], {, and } as special, you must also
<a class="N" rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">percent encode<img
    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a> 
    them in the erddapURL as &#37;5B, &#37;5D, &#37;7B, &#37;7D, respectively.
Fortunately, these are almost never in "files" filenames.
Then, in the erddapUrl, replace a zero-padded number (for example <kbd>01</kbd>) with a 
range of values (for example, <kbd>[01-15]</kbd> ), or replace a substring (for example <kbd>41004</kbd>) with a list of values (for example, <kbd>{41004,41009,41010}</kbd> ).
The <kbd>#1</kbd> within the output fileName causes the current value of the range or 
list to be put into the output fileName. For example, 
<pre>curl --compressed "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/files/cwwcNDBCMet/NDBC_{41004,41009,41010}_met.nc" -o ndbc/#1.nc</pre>
&nbsp;
</ul>

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="ViewMediaFiles" href="#ViewMediaFiles" rel="help"
>View Media Files</a></h3>
For most common image and video file types, the "files" system will now display a '?' icon 
to the left of the filename. If you hover over that, you will see a popup window showing 
the image or an audio or video player. 

<p>Similarly, for a few audio file types (notably .mp3, .ogg, and .wav), you will see an 
audio control which allows you to listen to the audio file.

<p>These preview features will only work for certain file types, in certain browsers, 
in certain operating systems. 
They rely on browser features, so they are largely out of our control.

<p>Alternatively, if you click on the link for an image, audio, or video file, a viewer
or player will open in a separate window. (If your browser asks you what you want
to do with the file, tell it to handle the media file itself (not via other software),
and tell it to 
remember this choice so that it will be used automatically in the future.)
<br>&nbsp;


<h3><a class="selfLink" id="HowCanIWorkWithTheseFiles" href="#HowCanIWorkWithTheseFiles" rel="help">"How can I work with these files?"</a></h3>
One of the main features of ERDDAP is that it allows you to download subsets
of a dataset (via the dataset's Data Access Form) in whatever file format you want
or make customizable graphs and maps via the dataset's Make A Graph web page
(so you don't have to download data files or install any graphing software). 
These allow you to avoid having to work with the original source data files
in file formats that you aren't familiar with and/or don't want to work with.

<p>If you instead choose to download and work with the original source files 
offered by ERDDAP's "files" system, you have to figure out how you want
to work with the files. 
Fortunately, there are lots of software tools for working with the various file types:
<ul>
<li><a class="selfLink" id="AllFileTypes" href="#AllFileTypes" rel="help">All File Types</a>
  <br>For all types of files, you can look up the file extension at sites like

    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>. 
  which give a basic description of the file type and list software that can 
  be used to work with the files (view, read, write, edit, etc.).
  Or, you can use your favorite search engine to search for what you want.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a class="selfLink" id="AudioFiles" href="#AudioFiles" rel="help">Audio Files</a>
  (for example, .3gp, .aiff, .au, .flac, .mp3, .ogg, .pcm, .wav, .wma)
  <br>The easiest way to hear most audio files offered by the "files" system is with 
  ERDDAP's system to <a rel="help" href="#ViewMediaFiles">view media files</a>

   are different than word processing files, which have special embedded
   formatting commands. If you import a text file into a word processor and make changes
   to the file, be sure to then save the file as an ASCII text file once again.
   Or, avoid this problem by using a text editor program.

   <p>If you edit .tsv (tab separated value) files, be very careful to maintain the
   tabs which separate the values in different "columns" on each row. 
   By default (even in many text editors), tabs often appear as spaces (or a few spaces).
   So be sure to use the editor's feature that makes tabs visible (as a special symbol)
   so that you can maintain the tabs between values.

  <p><a rel="help" href="#xmlFiles">.xml files</a> are technically text files, but there are advantages to 
  using separate XML editors to work with them.

  <p>There are dozens of text editor programs for every operating system, including:
  <ul>
  <li>Notepad comes with Windows (look in Window's Start list under Windows Accessories).
  <li>TextEdit comes with Mac OS X (look in the Applications folder).
  <li>Most Linux variants come with a few text editors, one of which is the default 
    (which you can change). 
    If you are using Linux, you probably already have a favorite.

<h3><a class="selfLink" id="byteRanges" href="#byteRanges" rel="help">Byte Range Requests</a></h3>
Unlike requests for most of the other resources in ERDDAP, a request for a file from the
"files" system (other than .nc and .hdf files) 
may include a "Range" request in the header which specifies a range of bytes to
be returned, instead of the whole file.
See <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving">Byte_serving<img
    src="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>. 
This is used by some client software (for example, audio and video players in web browsers) 
to request chunks of the file instead of the whole file.

<p>Accessing a remote file via byte ranges is often slow and inefficient.
Sometimes it's worth it for reading small samples of remote files, notably audio and video files.
But the more times you need access to the file, the more efficient it is to 
just download the file and then work with the local file.

<p>ERDDAP's /files/ system refuses all byte range requests to .nc and .hdf files, 
so don't even try to use Netcdf-java/c, ncview, Ferret, or other software tools to connect to 
.nc or .hdf files served by ERDDAP's /files/ system as if they were local files. 
These requests are blocked because this approach is horribly inefficient 
and often causes other problems. 
Instead:
<ul>
<li>Use (OPeN)DAP client software to connect to ERDDAP's DAP services for the dataset
  (which have /griddap/ or /tabledap/ in the URL). That's what DAP is for.
<li>Or, use the dataset's Data Access Form to request a subset of data.
<li>Or, if you need the entire file or repeated access over a long period of time,
  use curl, wget, or your browser to download the entire file from the /files/ system,
  then access the data from your local copy of the file.
</ul>

<functions>Server-side Functions</functions>

<functionTooltip><![CDATA[
TableDAP supports some server-side functions that modify the data
results table. They are <strong>optional</strong>.
Other than 'distinct()', they are <strong>rarely needed</strong>.
<p>Currently, each of the functions takes the results table as input and
returns the table with the same columns in the same order, but the
order of the rows, the number of rows, or data on the rows, is altered.
If you use more than one function, they will be applied in the order
that they appear in the request.
]]></functionTooltip>

<functionDistinctCheck>Check this if you want to use the distinct() function.</functionDistinctCheck>

<functionDistinctTooltip><![CDATA[
Checking 'distinct()' tells ERDDAP to sort the results table by all of the
variables selected above (with the top/first variable selected above
being the most important and other selected variables only being used
to break ties) and to remove all duplicate rows from the response table.
<p>WARNING: if this is used without constraints, ERDDAP may have to read
all rows from the datasource, which can be VERY SLOW for some datasets.
So you should usually include constraints (e.g., time minimum and maximum).
]]></functionDistinctTooltip>

<functionOrderByTooltip><![CDATA[
The orderBy... functions sort the rows of the results table and sometimes
groups them and sometimes further manipulates them.
To use an orderBy... function, select a function at left, then select one or
more variables at right, then optionally add addition settings, e.g.,
for numeric variables, you may specify variableName[/divisor[timeUnits][:offset]] .
To not use any orderBy... function, choose the first option at left ("").
The orderBy... functions are:

<p><strong>orderBy</strong> sorts the rows of the results table by the specified variables. 
For example, orderBy("stationID, time") sorts the results primarily by stationID and
secondarily by time.

<p><strong>orderByClosest</strong> sorts the rows of the results table by the specified variables. 
The last variable must be a numerical variable with a divisor.
Only the rows closest to the divisor's interval will be kept. 
For example, orderByClosest("stationID, time/2hours")
will sort by stationID and time,
but only return the rows for each stationID where the last orderBy column (time)
are closest to 2 hour intervals.

<p><strong>orderByCount</strong> sorts the rows of the results table into groups and just returns
the count of the number of non-missing-values for each group.
For example, orderByCount("stationID, time/1day") will sort by stationID and return one row
for each stationID for each day, with a count of the number of non-missing-values for 
each of the other variables.

<p><strong>orderByLimit</strong> sorts the rows of the results table into groups
and just returns the first nRows (as specified by the last orderByLimit value)
within each group.
For example, orderByMax("stationID, time/1day, 10") will sort by stationID and time,
but only return the first 10 rows for each stationID for each day.

<p><strong>orderByMax</strong> sorts the rows of the results table into groups
and just returns the row within each group with the maximum value of the 
last orderByMax variable in the request. 
For example, orderByMax("stationID, time/1day, temperature") will group the rows by stationID and each day,
but only return the row with the maximum temperature value for each stationID for each day.

<p><strong>orderByMin</strong> is like orderByMax, but only keeps the row with
the minimum value for the last orderByMin variable.

<p><strong>orderByMinMax</strong> is like orderByMin plus orderByMax.
Within each sort group, only the row with the
minimum value and the row with the maximum value for the last orderByMinMax
variable will be kept.
For example, orderByMinMax("stationID, time/1day, temperature") will return the row with the
minimum temperature value and the row with the maximum temperature value
for each stationID for each day.

<p><strong>orderByMean</strong> sorts the rows of the results table into groups
and just returns one row for each group. That row will have the mean of each of the other variables.
For example, orderByMax("stationID, time/1day") will create a group for each
stationID for each day, and will calculate and return the mean of the other variables.
]]></functionOrderByTooltip>

<functionOrderByExtra>For orderByClosest, specify the interval (using the format n[timeUnits], e.g., 1 hour) here.
&lt;br&gt;For orderByLimit, specify the maximum number of rows per group here.</functionOrderByExtra>

<p><strong>If you are having login problems, for example,</strong>
<ul>
<li>You just logged in, but private datasets in ERDDAP still aren't visible.
<li>You just logged in, but some ERDDAP web pages indicate you aren't logged in.
  And if you try to log in again, ERDDAP says you are already logged in.
<li>You logged in a while ago and now, after a period of inactivity, ERDDAP says 
    you aren't logged in.
</ul>
<p><strong>Try these solutions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are using the http<strong>s</strong> URL.
  On many ERDDAPs, web pages can be accessed via http or https URLs.
  If you use an http URL, ERDDAP considers you to be not logged in, even if you 
    would be if you used https.
  So if you think you're logged in and ERDDAP is acting as if you aren't,
    make sure you're using the https (not the http) URL.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Click on your browser's Reload button.
  Your browser may have cached the web page before you logged in.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>After a period of inactivity, if ERDDAP says you aren't logged in, 
    you have to log in again.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>If you have multiple accounts, make sure you are logged in with the appropriate 
    name to see the desired datasets.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Try logging out, then logging in again.
  <br>&nbsp;
&second;
<li>Contact the administrator of this ERDDAP: &adminContact;.
  It is possible that some datasets are not currently available or that you don't 
      have permission to access them.

<strong>Search Hints</strong><ul><li>This is a Google-like search of the datasets' metadata:
 Type the words you want to search for, with spaces between the words.
 ERDDAP will search for the words separately, not as a phrase.
<li>To search for a phrase, put double quotes around the phrase
(for example, <kbd>&quot;wind speed&quot;</kbd>).
<li>To exclude datasets with a specific word, use <kbd>-<i>excludedWord</i></kbd> .
To exclude datasets with a specific phrase, use
<kbd>-&quot;<i>excluded phrase</i>&quot;</kbd> .
<li>Don't use <kbd>AND</kbd> between search terms. It is implied.
The results will include only the datasets that have all of the specified
words and phrases (and none of the excluded words and phrases) in the
dataset's metadata (data about the dataset).
<li>Searches are not case-sensitive.
<li>To find just grid or just table datasets, include <kbd>protocol=griddap</kbd>

<li>In this ERDDAP, the last word in a phrase may be a partial word. For

ERDDAP has an email/URL subscription system so that you can be notified immediately whenever
a dataset changes (for example, whenever new data is added to a near-real-time dataset).

<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</strong>
<ul>
<li> ERDDAP will store the information that you provide, including your email address.
<li> ERDDAP will treat the information that you provide as confidential and will not release it to
  anyone else.
<li> These subscriptions have nothing to do with getting the actual data (see
  <a class="N" rel="start" href="{0}/index.html">ERDDAP''s home page</a>).
<li> ERDDAP is very good at detecting changes to gridded datasets because it can detect when
  the axis values (e.g., the time values) change.
<li> ERDDAP is not very good at detecting changes to tabular datasets because there are usually
  no changes to the metadata when new data is added.
<li> ERDDAP will detect if a dataset becomes unavailable (but perhaps not immediately).
  ERDDAP will immediately detect when that dataset becomes available again.
<li> No one and no organization associated with this ERDDAP makes any promises about the
  suitability, reliability, or correctness of this service

<h2>Easier Access to Scientific Data</h2>
Our focus is on making it easier for you to get scientific data.

<p><strong>Different scientific communities have developed different types of data servers.</strong>
<p>For example, OPeNDAP, WCS, SOS, OBIS, and countless custom web pages with forms.
Each is great on its own.
But without ERDDAP, it is difficult to get data from different types of servers:
<ul>
<li>Different data servers make you format your data request in different ways.
<li>Different data servers return data in different formats, usually not the common file format that you want.
<li>Different datasets use different formats for time data, so the results are hard to compare.
</ul>

<!-- We believe that by focusing on your needs, ERDDAP can make it easier to get data.
make it easier for you to get scientific data.-->

<p><strong>ERDDAP unifies the different types of data servers
  so you have a consistent way to get the data you want, in the format you want.</strong>
<ul>
<li>ERDDAP acts as a middleman between you and various remote data servers.
  When you request data from ERDDAP,
    ERDDAP reformats the request into the format required by the remote server,
    sends the request to the remote server, gets the data, reformats the data into the
    format that you requested, and sends the data to you.
    You no longer have to go to different data servers to get data from different datasets.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li>ERDDAP offers an easy-to-use, consistent way to request data: via the OPeNDAP standard.
&wmsManyDatasets;
  <br>&nbsp;

<li>ERDDAP returns data in the common file format of your choice.
  ERDDAP offers all data as .html table, ESRI .asc and .csv, Google Earth .kml, 
    OPeNDAP binary, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .csv, .tsv, .json, and .xhtml.
    So you no longer have to waste time and effort reformatting data.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li>ERDDAP can also return a .png or .pdf image with a customized graph or map.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li>ERDDAP standardizes the dates+times in the results.
  Data from other data servers is hard to compare
    because the dates+times often are expressed in different formats
    (for example, "Jan 2, 2018", 02-JAN-2018, 1/2/18, 2/1/18,
    2018-01-02, "days since Jan 1, 1900").
  For string times, ERDDAP always uses the ISO 8601:2004(E) standard format,
    for example, 2018-01-02T00:00:00Z.
  For numeric times, ERDDAP always uses "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".
  ERDDAP always uses the Zulu (UTC, GMT) time zone to remove the difficulties
    of working with different time zones and standard time versus daylight saving time.
&convertTimeReference;  
  <br>&nbsp;

<li>ERDDAP has web pages (for humans with browsers) and 
     <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/rest.html">RESTful&nbsp;web&nbsp;services</a> 
     (for computer programs).
  You can bypass ERDDAP's web pages and use ERDDAP's RESTful web services 
    (for example, for searching for datasets, for downloading data, for making maps)
    directly from any computer program (for example, Matlab, R, or a program that you write)
    and even from web pages (via HTML image tags or JavaScript).  
  You can also build other useful and interesting things on top of ERDDAP's web services

<p><strong>Data Providers: You can
  <a rel="help" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html">set up your own ERDDAP server</a>
  and serve your own data.</strong>
ERDDAP is free and open source. It uses Apache-like licenses, 
so you can do anything you want with it.
ERDDAP's appearance is customizable, so your ERDDAP will reflect your institution, not NOAA. 
The small effort to set up ERDDAP brings many benefits.
If you already have a web service for distributing your data,
you can set up ERDDAP to access your data via the existing service
or via the source files or database.
Then, people will have another way to access your data
and will be able to download the data in additional file formats
or as graphs or maps.
ERDDAP has been installed by over 60 organizations worldwide.

<!-- Bob: see identical table css in Table.ERD_TABLE_CSS --> 
<!-- startHeadHtml has the start of the HTML document and the 'head' tags 
(starting at "<!DOCTYPE", but not including "</head>") 
for all HTML web pages. 
This may include &erddapUrl;, which is expanded to be [baseUrl]/erddap
  (or [baseUttpsUrl]/erddap if the user is logged in).
If your ERDDAP allows users to log in, all referenced image files, css files, 
  etc. must be in [tomcat]/content/erddap/images or a subdirectory

favicon.ico is the image that browsers associate with your website.
For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon .
You can use your own favicon.ico file by putting it in (tomcat)/content/erddap/images. 

*** If your CSS style includes links to files (e.g., images), that style
information must be inline in the style tag below, after the 'import' line, 
not in the .css file.  
Put all of the (e.g., image) files in the <tomcat>/content/erddap/images
directory (or a subdirectory) and reference them below starting with
&erddapUrl;.
Why? On ERDDAP https: web pages, *all* links should use https: (not http:);
otherwise, most browsers consider the web page not fully secure.
Because ERDDAP would use the same .css file for http: and https: web pages,
the links within the .css file wouldn't switch between http: and https:.
There doesn't seem to be a way around this other than using inline style 
information.

<h2><a class="selfLink" id="problems" href="#problems" rel="bookmark">The Problems that ERDDAP Tries To Solve</a></h2>
Without ERDDAP, when a person (or a computer program) looks on the Internet for a
specific type of scientific data (for example, satellite sea surface temperature data),
there are problems ...
<ul>
<li>Interesting datasets are hard to find because they are at many different websites.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Each site requires a different protocol to request the data
  &requestFormatExamplesHtml;.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Each site returns the data in a different format (for example, XML, SOAP+XML, OPeNDAP binary
  data stream, ASCII text, HDF 4, HDF 5, NetCDF, ...) and it isn't the common file format
  that you want.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Data from different sites is hard to compare because the dates+times are expressed in
  different formats for example, "Jan 2, 1985", "02-JAN-1985", "1/2/85", "2/1/85",
  "1985-01-02", or days since Jan 1, 1980, or ...).

    but ERDDAP (the program) can access and serve any gridded or tabular data.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="search" href="#search" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP
offers several ways to search for interesting datasets.</a></strong>
  <br>For example,
  <a href="&erddapUrl;/search/index.html">full text search</a>,
  <a href="&erddapUrl;/categorize/index.html">search by category</a> 
  (also known as faceted search), and

  Advanced Search combines all of the search techniques
  and adds searches for datasets that have data within longitude, latitude, and time ranges,

    (OPeNDAP is great!)
  ERDDAP translates your request from the OPeNDAP, WMS, or SOS format to the data source's
  request format and converts the response to one of ERDDAP's internal data structures.
  Then ERDDAP reformats the data in the common file format of your choice (for example, as an
  .html table, ESRI .asc, Google Earth .kml, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .csv, .tsv, .json, .xhtml, .png, .pdf)
  and sends the file to you.
  See the list of

  and the list of 
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/documentation.html#fileType">tabledap file types</a>.
  Other protocols for requesting the data (for example,

    may be added in the future.
  ERDDAP is structured for these additions and there don't seem to be any impediments.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="userUnits" href="#userUnits" rel="bookmark">Requests for gridded data can be made in user units.</a></strong>
  <br>Although requests for gridded data in ERDDAP can be made with array indices
  (following the OPeNDAP specification), requests can also be in user units
  (for example, degrees east), using
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/documentation.html#parentheses">a parentheses notation</a>,
  since users think in those units,
  not indices.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="fileFormats" href="#fileFormats" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP sends results in common data file formats.</a></strong>
  <br>The results can be returned in any of several common data file formats
  &resultsFormatExamplesHtml;,
  instead of just the original format or just the OPeNDAP transfer format (which has no
  standard file manifestation). These files are created on-the-fly.
  Since there are few internal data structures, it is easy to add additional file-type drivers.

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="LLAT" href="#LLAT" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP standardizes the variable names and units for longitude, latitude, altitude,
  depth, and time in the results.</a></strong>
  <br>To facilitate comparisons of data from different datasets, the requests and results in ERDDAP
  use standardized space/time axis units:
  <ul>
  <li>longitude is always in degrees_east.
  <li>latitude is always in degrees_north.
  <li>altitude is always in meters with positive=up.
  <li>depth is always in meters with positive=down.
  <li>time, when formatted as a number, is always in "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    (known as <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a> or epoch seconds,
    which is

      >UDUNITS<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>-compatible)
      and, when formatted as a string, is formatted according
    to the
      <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601:2004 "extended" format<img

    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
      standard <span class="N">(yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ,</span> for example,
      <span class="N">"1985-01-02T00:00:00Z").</span>
    (You can convert numeric times to/from ISO string times with ERDDAP's
      <a rel="bookmark" href="&erddapUrl;/convert/time.html">time converter</a>.)
    Also, to avoid time zone and daylight saving time confusion, time values are always
    converted to the Zulu (UTC, GMT) time zone.
  </ul>
  This makes it easy to specify constraints in requests without having to worry about the altitude
  data format (are positive values up or down? in meters or fathoms?) or the time data format
  (a nightmarish realm of possible formats, for example, "Jan 2, 1985",
  "02-JAN-1985", "1/2/85", "2/1/85", "1985-01-02", or days since Jan 1, 1980).
  This makes the results from different data sources easy to compare.

  <br>For more details, see 
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/convert/time.html#erddap">How ERDDAP Deals with Time</a>.

  <p>Because the longitude, latitude, altitude, and time variables are specifically recognized,
  ERDDAP is aware of the geo/temporal features of each dataset.
  This is useful when making images with maps or time-series, and when saving data
  in geo-referenced file types (e.g., .esriAscii, .geoJson, and .kml).

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="compression" href="#compression" rel="bookmark">Requesting Compressed Files</a></strong>
  <br>ERDDAP doesn't offer results stored in compressed (e.g., .zip or .gzip) files.
  Instead, ERDDAP looks for
  <a rel="help" href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/"
    >accept-encoding<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
     in the HTTP GET request header sent by the client.
  If a supported compression type ("gzip", "x-gzip", or "deflate") is found in the
  accept-encoding list, ERDDAP includes "content-encoding" in the HTTP response header
  and compresses the data as it transmits it.
  It is up to the client program to look for "content-encoding" and decompress the data.
  Compressed responses are often 3-10 times faster, although there is no benefit 
  to requesting compressed .png files since the files' contents are already compressed. 
  Browsers and OPeNDAP clients do this by default. They request compressed data and
  decompress the returned data automatically.
  Other clients (e.g., Java programs) have to do this explicitly.
  With curl, add <kbd>--compressed</kbd> to the command line to tell curl to 
  request a compressed response and automatically decompress it.

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="interoperable" href="#interoperable" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP
    makes different types of data servers (OPeNDAP, OBIS, SOS, WMS, ...) interoperable.</a></strong>
  <br>Different types of data servers are used in different scientific communities.
  In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that any one type will become dominant and
  replace the others. So ERDDAP acts as a bridge between different types of
  client programs (web browsers, IDV, Matlab, netCDF programs, ODV, WMS clients, etc.)
  and the different types of data servers.
  <ol>
  <li>ERDDAP accepts client requests for data in different formats (e.g., OPeNDAP, WMS).
  <li>ERDDAP converts a given request into the request format used by the source data server
    (e.g., OPeNDAP, SOS, OBIS, ...) and sends that to the source data server.
  <li>ERDDAP converts the response data from the source data server into an internal format,
    including converting all time data to a common format: "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".
  <li>ERDDAP converts the data from the internal format into the file format requested by the client
    (e.g., .csv, Google Earth .kml, .htmlTable, .dods, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .png).
  </ol>
  Clients don't have to worry about, or know about, the type of the source data server.
  They just get the data they want, in the file format they want.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="dataStructures" href="#dataStructures" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP uses just two basic data structures to hold data.</a></strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Since it is difficult for human clients and computer clients to deal with a complex set of
    possible dataset structures, ERDDAP uses just two basic data structures:
    <ul>
    <li>a <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/documentation.html#dataModel">gridded data structure</a>
      (for example, for satellite data and model data) and
    <li>a <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/documentation.html#dataModel">tabular data structure</a>
      (for example, for in-situ buoy, station, and trajectory data).
    </ul>
  <li>Certainly, not all data can be expressed in these structures, but much of it can.
    Tables, in particular, are very flexible data structures (look at the phenomenal success
    of
      <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">relational database<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a> programs).
  <li>This makes data queries easier to construct.
  <li>This makes data responses have a simple structure, which makes it easier to serve the data
    in a wider variety of standard file types (which often just support simple data structures).
    This is the main reason that we set up ERDDAP this way.
  <li>This, in turn, makes it very easy for us (or anyone) to write client software which works
    with all ERDDAP datasets.
  <li>This makes it easier to compare data from different sources, for example for an
    Integrated Ecosystem Analysis (IEA).
  <li>We are very aware that if you are used to working with data in other data structures
    you may initially think that this approach is simplistic or insufficient.
    But all data structures have tradeoffs. None is perfect.
    Even the do-it-all structures have their downsides: working with them is complex and
    the files can only be written or read with special software libraries.
    If you accept ERDDAP's approach enough to try to work with it, you may find that it has
    its advantages (notably the support for multiple file types that can hold the data responses).
    The  
    <a rel="help" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/erddapTalk/erddapTechTalk.html">original ERDDAP slide show</a>

    structures slide</a>)
    talks about these issues.
  <li>And even if this approach sounds odd to you, most ERDDAP clients will never notice --
    they will simply see that all of the datasets have a nice simple structure and they will
    be thankful that they can get data from a wide variety of sources returned in a wide
    variety of file formats.

     ERDDAP offers a separate RSS 2.01 feed for each dataset so that you can find out
     when interesting datasets have changed.
     To subscribe to a dataset's RSS feed, click on one of the RSS icons
       <img alt="RSS" style="vertical-align:top" title="The RSS icon." src="&erddapUrl;/images/rss.gif" >

        (<a href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/etopo180.html">example</a>).

  <p><strong>Comparison</strong>
    The RSS service may be just what you are looking for.  It is a nice standard.
    But if you need to know as soon as possible when a dataset changes, use the
    email/URL system, not RSS. RSS clients periodically (every hour?) request and read
    the RSS XML document to look for changes.
    So typically, an RSS client will not detect a change to a dataset quickly (average 30 minutes?).
    In contrast, the email/URL subscription system acts immediately whenever ERDDAP detects
    a change to a dataset.
    The more proactive approach of the email/URL system is also much more efficient:
    You may be able to set your RSS client to check for changes every minute (don't do it!),
    but that would just lead to lots of unnecessary requests to the ERDDAP server
    and it still wouldn't detect changes immediately.

  <br>These features can be used to build another web service on top of ERDDAP

  ERDDAP is not intended to be a high-level data exploration/graphing service.
  Instead, ERDDAP is intended to provide services for such websites and programs.
  So if you have an idea for a better interface to the data the ERDDAP serves,
  we encourage you to build your own web application or web service, and use ERDDAP

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="security" href="#security" rel="bookmark">Security</a></strong> - By default, ERDDAP runs as an entirely public server with no login
  system and no restrictions to data access.
  However, an ERDDAP administrator can configure ERDDAP to restrict access to some
  or all datasets to users who log in and have been assigned certain roles.
  ERDDAP has built-in methods for authentication (logging in).
  If an ERDDAP installation has authentication turned on, there will be a "log in" link
  at the top of each web page.
  Users never have to log in to access the publicly available datasets.
  Users who have logged in can access public datasets and the private datasets to which
  they are allowed access.
  Users must use https: (Secure Sockets Layer) to log in and to access private datasets.
  Datasets can configured to have graphs and maps publicly accessible, 
    but have data only accessible to authorized users.

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="chunks" href="#chunks" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP processes data in chunks.</a></strong>
  <br>To save memory (a big issue) and make responses start sooner, ERDDAP processes
  data requests in chunks &mdash; repeatedly getting a chunk of data from the source,
  cleaning it up (for example, adding
    <a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>),
    and sending that to the client.
  For many data sources, this means that the first chunk of data (for example, from the
  first sensor) gets to the client in seconds instead of minutes (for example, after data
  from the last sensor has been retrieved), reassuring the client that the data is coming.
  From a memory standpoint, this allows numerous large requests (each larger than available
  memory) to be handled simultaneously.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="modular" href="#modular" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP has a modular structure.</a></strong>
  <br>ERDDAP is structured so that it is easy to add different components
  (for example, a class to request data from an SOS server and store it as a table).
  The new component then gains all the features and capabilities of the parent
  (for example, support for OPeNDAP requests and the ability to save the data in several
  common file formats).
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><strong><a class="selfLink" id="pushPull" href="#pushPull" rel="bookmark">Data Dissemination / Data Distribution Networks: Push and Pull Technology</a></strong>
<br>Normally, ERDDAP acts as an intermediary: it takes a request from a user;
gets data from a remote data source; reformats the data; and sends it to the user.
<a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_technology">Pull Technology<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>:
But ERDDAP also has the ability to actively get all of the available data
from a remote data source and
<a rel="help" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridCopy">store
a local copy of the data</a>.
<a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology">Push Technology<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>:
By using ERDDAP's <a href="#subscriptions">subscription services</a>,
other data servers can be notified
as soon as new data is available so that they can request the data (by pulling the data).
ERDDAP's
<a rel="help"  href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridFromErddap">EDDGridFromErddap</a> and <a rel="help"  href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromErddap">EDDTableFromErddap</a> use ERDDAP's subscription services and
<a rel="help" href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#flag">flag system</a>
so that they will be notified immediately when new data is available.
You can combine these to great effect:
if you wrap an EDDGridCopy around an EDDGridFromErddap dataset
(or wrap an EDDTableCopy around an EDDTableFromErddap dataset),
ERDDAP will automatically create and maintain a local copy of another ERDDAP's dataset.
Because the subscription services work as soon as new data is available,
push technology disseminates data very quickly (within seconds).

<p>This architecture puts each ERDDAP administrator in charge of determining where the data
for his/her ERDDAP comes from. Other ERDDAP administrators can do the same.
There is no need for coordination between administrators.
If many ERDDAP administrators link to each other's ERDDAPs,
a data distribution network is formed.
Data will be quickly, efficiently, and automatically disseminated from data sources
(ERDDAPs and other servers) to data redistribution sites (ERDDAPs) anywhere in the network.
A given ERDDAP can be both a source of data for some datasets and a redistribution site
for other datasets.
The resulting network is roughly similar to data distribution networks set up with programs
like
   <a rel="bookmark" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idd/">Unidata's IDD/IDM<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>,
   but less rigidly structured.
<br>&nbsp;

</ul>


<p><strong><a class="selfLink" id="sweetSpot" href="#sweetSpot" rel="bookmark">Is ERDDAP a solution to everyone's data distribution / data access problems?</a></strong>
<br>No. ERDDAP tries to find a sweet spot that is a really good solution to most of the
data distribution problems that we confronted.
ERDDAP takes a middleware approach:
It can get data from lots of different types of remote data servers
and it can give that data to clients in lots of different file formats.
It is designed to be an agnostic solution which seeks to make other data servers
(OPeNDAP, SOS, OBIS, WMS, ...) interoperable.
Is there one perfect data server that meets everyone's needs perfectly?  We don't think so.
And even if you think there is or will be, it will be a long time before everyone switches
to it, if ever. Until then, ERDDAP is available right now to make other data servers
interoperable and to serve data right now.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="complexDatasets" href="#complexDatasets" rel="bookmark">ERDDAP can handle many/most datasets as is, but not all.</a>
It isn't that the remaining datasets (e.g., model data using a cubed sphere projection)
aren't important.  It's just that ERDDAP's goal of returning data in common file formats
(some of which are pretty simple), precludes a more complex internal data structure.
Groups of researchers working with more complex data structures often already have specialized
data servers and specialized client software which are customized to their community's needs.
ERDDAP, as a general purpose data server, doesn't try to compete with these specialized data servers.
They are customized to the needs of their community and do a great job.
However, those datasets are often only "understood" by the specialized software in that community.

<p>A Work-Around for Complex Datasets - ERDDAP has a way to handle complex datasets that it
can't handle directly. Just as a
<a rel="help" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system"
  >relational database<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>
can store a complex dataset by using just
one simple data structure (a table), ERDDAP can serve the data from more complex datasets by
breaking the source dataset into a few ERDDAP datasets, each with similar, simple data structures.
For example, some gridded environmental model datasets can be stored in ERDDAP by
putting the sea surface variables ([time][latitude][longitude]) in one ERDDAP dataset,
and by putting the variables with altitude ([time][altitude][latitude][longitude])
in another ERDDAP dataset. We know this isn't ideal, but it is necessary to allow ERDDAP
to return data in common file formats (some of which are pretty simple).

<p>Another approach to dealing with complex datasets (e.g., for model data using a cubed
sphere projection) is to also offer a reprojected version of the dataset
([time][altitude][latitude][longitude]) which ERDDAP can work with easily.
These simpler data structures aren't meant to replace the original data structures,
but they can be a useful way to distribute the data to a wider audience.


<br>&nbsp;
<p><a class="selfLink" id="sustainable" href="#sustainable" rel="bookmark"><strong>How sustainable is the ERDDAP project?</strong></a>
<br>ERDDAP is very sustainable.
<br>Some people are surprised and disappointed to hear that ERDDAP is mostly
developed by one person (me, Bob Simons). 
[By the way, the opinions on this web page are my personal opinions and 
do not necessarily reflect any position of the 
Government or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.]
They fear that if something happens
to me, that will be end of ERDDAP. That is simply not true. 
ERDDAP's positioning for long-term sustainability is excellent, 
perhaps the best it could possibly be.

<p>Yes, I am the main developer of ERDDAP. I am a fully funded federal employee. 
My funding isn't "soft" money, so I don't receive or rely on grants.
I spend more than half my time developing ERDDAP. 
The rest of my time is spent managing datasets. 
That work is useful for ERDDAP because I need to work with real datasets in order to
know in detail what ERDDAP needs to do. My bosses fully support my work on
ERDDAP because it does what I was hired to do: make it easier for fisheries
scientists (primarily, but really everyone) to get scientific data from diverse
sources.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="miraculous" href="#miraculous" rel="bookmark">The miraculous
thing about software is that it costs nothing to duplicate.</a> 
So to do my job, I write ERDDAP for use at ERD. I think that is the best possible way
for me to do my job. That reason alone justifies the
expense of developing ERDDAP. (I think it could be shown that ERDDAP has saved
more NOAA scientist's time than that I have spent developing ERDDAP. Time=Money.)
But the side benefit is that any other organization can 
<a rel="bookmark" 
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html">download, install, and use ERDDAP</a>
<strong>for free</strong> to distribute their scientific data.  
<br><a rel="bookmark" 
href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#organizations">Over 60 organizations around the world use ERDDAP</a>. Maybe there is such a thing as a free lunch.

<p>ERDDAP is a Java program. The source code
for every version is on 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://github.com/BobSimons">GitHub<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>,
the most commonly used system for collaborative
software projects. One person in France has also contributed code (thank you!).
I hope others will contribute code in the future.
If something happens to me, my bosses will hire a replacement with the specific goal that
s/he continues the development of ERDDAP.
Further, I try to write very clean code. I write Java Doc comments. I write
comments in the code. I chose variable names carefully. I follow the Java formatting guidelines.
All of this is an effort
to make the code more readable, for other programmers who want to understand
and/or change it, and for me, because, in a year or two, I will have forgotten
the details of how and why the code was written the way it was.  
Clean code with good comments makes my ongoing work on ERDDAP easier, so I have a
great incentive to write clean code with good comments.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="FOSS" href="#FOSS" rel="bookmark">But all of my answers so far are not very important.</a> 
Only one thing that is really important. Only one thing guarantees sustainability
for ERDDAP or any software project: that ERDDAP is 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>.
Specifically, ERDDAP uses 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache-compatible software licenses<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>,
so anyone can do anything they want with the code.

<p>Why is that important? One might think that software will be reliably available 
in the future because a big 
company is behind it. But Google, for example, has discontinued numerous projects 
(<a rel="bookmark"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services"
>here's a list<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external website does not constitute an endorsement."></a>).
I don't want to pick on Google because I really like Google and they 
fund a large number of great, open-source projects. Microsoft has
discontinued projects. Apple has discontinued projects. ... 
The point is that just having the backing of a large company is no assurance
that the project will continue.
The users of that software are out of luck, 
<strong>unless</strong> the software was (and therefore, is) Free and Open Source Software 
(FOSS). Then, whenever there is interest by even one developer, the project can and will 
continue to evolve. FOSS is an insurance policy. In fact, FOSS is the only
insurance policy, the only assurance, that matters. FOSS insures that there
is always a way forward for the software. That is a right that no one can 
take away, ever. 

<p><a class="selfLink" id="largeTeam" href="#largeTeam" rel="bookmark">One might also think that software that has a large team of developers</a> 
will be more sustainable than software with one main developer. But 
lots of developers usually need lots of funding. I know a famous, reasonably 
large project with 10 developers (I won't embarrass them by naming them) that is
in constant serious danger of stopping the project because they don't have
enough funding. They rely on grants. They always run a deficit. Their patron always bails them 
out at the last minute, but is getting really tired of bailing them out. 
So if they can't raise a million dollars a year in grant money 
(or the patron gets too tired of bailing them out), they'll stop. And the group can't 
conceive of having fewer than 10 developers. Each developer has a role to play
in their group. In light of that, it seems to me that it is a great sign 
that ERDDAP can be, and is, actively developed by just one main developer (who is
fully funded) with the unofficial assistance of a few others. 
If fact, it would be a bad sign if ERDDAP required multiple
developers. That ERDDAP has just one main developer means that it isn't a huge 
task that requires massive ongoing funding; it is a relatively small task 
that requires minimal effort and funding. That is more sustainable, not less.

<p><a class="selfLink" id="contractingCompany" href="#contractingCompany" rel="bookmark">One might think that hiring a contracting company 
to write software is a good idea.</a> 
For a fee, they'll provide developers and promise continuity (which
is good unless/until they go out of business). But they 
also have you over a barrel: you must pay them what they request or there is
no more development, <strong>unless</strong> the software is FOSS and you're just paying them
to work on the code. With FOSS, you always have choices about how to move forward.
Because ERDDAP is FOSS, contractors are always a good option for you or anyone
with regard to ERDDAP: if anything happens to me (the one main developer), or if I don't have time to
make some change that you want, or I retire and you don't like my replacement's work, 
you can always hire a contracting company to make the changes you want (or make them yourself). 

<p><a class="selfLink" id="sustainabilitySummary" href="#sustainabilitySummary" rel="bookmark">In summary,
ERDDAP has the two sustainability features that matter most:</a>
<ol>
<li>ERDDAP is a small project (small enough to be handled by one main developer 
with the unofficial assistance of a few others), so it doesn't require massive resources.
<li>ERDDAP is Free and Open Source Software, so no one can ever stop you or anyone else 
  from working on ERDDAP. 
</ol>
I cannot think of a better situation. 
I hope that relieves any fears you (or anyone else) had about ERDDAP's sustainability.
