<!-- This is a description of Advanced Search. -->
<advancedSearchHtml><![CDATA[
Advanced Search combines all of the search techniques
<br>and adds searches for datasets that have data within longitude, latitude, and time ranges,
<br>so you can search for datasets based on many different criteria simultaneously.
]]></advancedSearchHtml>

and Time Ranges</advancedSearchBounds>

<advancedSearchMinLat>Minimum Latitude</advancedSearchMinLat>
<advancedSearchMaxLat>Maximum Latitude</advancedSearchMaxLat>
<advancedSearchMinLon>Minimum Longitude</advancedSearchMinLon>
<advancedSearchMaxLon>Maximum Longitude</advancedSearchMaxLon>

<advancedSearchClear>Clear</advancedSearchClear>
<advancedSearchClearHelp>Clear all of the Longitude and Latitude textfields
and the rectangle on the map.</advancedSearchClearHelp>

<advancedSearchCategoryTooltip><![CDATA[
Datasets can be categorized in different ways
<br>based on the values of various metadata attributes.
<p>Most datasets have multiple values for some attributes,
<br>for example, the "long_name" associated with each variable.
<br>To search for more than one value, enter additional values in the Full Text
<br>textfield above, e.g., <tt>"long_name=Sea Surface Temperature"</tt>.
]]></advancedSearchCategoryTooltip>

<advancedSearchRangeTooltip><![CDATA[
Datasets will match these criteria if they have a least some matching data.
<p>All grid datasets that have longitude, latitude and time variables
<br>have the data-range information needed to do these tests.
<br>Unfortunately, some tabular datasets have the variables, but don't have
<br>the data-range information. They will be excluded from the search results.
]]></advancedSearchRangeTooltip>

<advancedSearchMapTooltip><![CDATA[
This is optional.
<br>You can specify longitude and latitude bounds by entering text in the textfields,
<br>or you can specify a rectangle on the map by clicking on two diagonal corners.
<br>(To change the rectangle, click on the new corners.)
<br>Drawing a rectangle on the map automatically puts values in the longitude and 
<br>latitude textfields. 
<br>The values in the longitude and latitude textfields are what really count.
<br>Drawing a rectangle on the map is just an easy way to specify those values.
]]></advancedSearchMapTooltip>

<advancedSearchLonTooltip><![CDATA[
<p>Some datasets have longitude values within -180 to 180, others use 0 to 360.
<br>If you specify Min and Max Longitude within -180 to 180 (or 0 to 360),
<br>ERDDAP will only find datasets that match the values you specify.
<br>Consider doing one search: longitude -180 to 360,
<br>or two searches: longitude -180 to 180, and 0 to 360.
]]></advancedSearchLonTooltip>

<advancedSearchTimeTooltip><![CDATA[
This is optional.
<ul>
<li>Enter a time string with the format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ, 
  <br>for example, 2009-01-21T23:00:00Z.
  <br>If you specify something, you must include yyyy-MM-dd.
  <br>You can omit (backwards from the end) Z, :ss, :mm, :HH, and T.
  <br>Always use UTC (GMT/Zulu) time.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Or specify the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
</ul>
]]></advancedSearchTimeTooltip>

<!-- {0}=plainFileType (e.g., .json) of advanced search query. -->
<advancedSearchWithCriteria>A {0} Advanced Search request must include one or more criteria, for example, "?page=1&amp;itemsPerPage=1000&amp;searchFor=wind+temperature".</advancedSearchWithCriteria>

<advancedSearchFewerCriteria>Try using fewer and/or broader search criteria.</advancedSearchFewerCriteria>

  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a name="background">Background</a> - 
  The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 6-4 assigned
  <br>numbers to U.S. counties, county equivalents, states, and possessions.
  <br>On September 2, 2008, the standard was withdrawn by NIST. But the list is

  This service requires exact matches. Entering a partial county code or
  <br>county name, or using a different case (upper or lower), will result in an error
  <br>error message.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a name="digits">5-Digit Codes</a> -
  This service works with the 5-digit version of the FIPS county codes.
  <br>The first two digits are the FIPS state code.  The last three digits are the FIPS
  <br>county code within that state or possession.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a name="names">County Names</a> -
  The format for the county names isn't standardized.
  <br>Here, they are written as "STATE, County Name", where STATE is the 2-letter
  <br>postal abbreviation.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a name="states">States</a> -
  This service includes the state names in with the county names.
  <br>The last 3 digits of the state's "county" codes are 000. For example, 06000 = CA.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li><a name="equivalent">County-Equivalent Entities</a> -
  This service includes county-equivalent entities from
  <br>U.S. protectorates and freely associated states originally in Appendix A and B of the

<br>Usually, there are more than one GCMD Science Keywords associated with a given
<br>CF Standard Name, and vice versa.  For example, converting the CF Standard Name<tt>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;air_pressure</tt> 
<br>into GCMD Science Keywords leads to<tt>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere &gt; Atmospheric Pressure &gt; Atmospheric Pressure Measurements
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere &gt; Atmospheric Pressure &gt; Sea Level Pressure </tt>and<tt>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere &gt; Atmospheric Pressure &gt; Static Pressure.</tt>
<br>This is useful if, for example, you have a dataset with CF Standard Names
<br>and want to add GCMD Science Keywords to the dataset's <tt>keywords</tt> metadata.

</ul>

<p><a name="erddap"><b>How ERDDAP Deals with Time</b></a>
<ul>
<li><a name="difficult">Time</a> is a difficult, complex, messy issue.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="goal">Goal</a> - An underlying goal for ERDDAP''s system for dealing with time is 
  to have a single
  <br>system that allows time data from any dataset to be compared directly to time data from
  <br>any other dataset. Please keep that in mind when you read the other comments below.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="timePoints">Time Points</a> - ERDDAP only deals with time points (a combined
  date+time in the 
  <br>Zulu time zone, each an instant in time).
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="timeZones">Time Zones</a> - When writing time values, ERDDAP always uses the Zulu (UTC, GMT)
  <br>time zone and never uses daylight savings times.  Time data from a source with 
  <br>time zone information (which may incorporate daylight savings time information) 
  <br>is converted to Zulu time. Time data from a source without time zone information 
  <br>is assumed to be already in Zulu time.
  <br>&nbsp;
  
<li><a name="precision">Precision</a> - ERDDAP deals with time internally as 
  "seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z", 
  <br>ignoring <a rel="help" href="#leapSeconds">leap seconds</a>, stored as double precision floating point numbers. Thus,
  <br>most time data can be stored very precisely (roughly to the nearest microsecond,
  <br>but progressively less precisely very far in the past or future).  
  <br>&nbsp;
  <br>When doing calculations, ERDDAP often works to the nearest millisecond, to 
  <br>avoid problems with floating point numbers that are slightly more or less 
  <br>than you expect.
  <br>&nbsp;
  <br>When representing times as numbers, ERDDAP always leaves the numbers at their full
  <br>precision.
  <br>&nbsp;
  <br>By default, when representing times as Strings, ERDDAP formats times to the 
  <br>(truncated) second (i.e., omitting millis). However, ERDDAP administrators can
  <br>configure specific variables in specific datasets to represent String times at 
  <br>other precisions (e.g., from millisecond precision up to month precision; see the 
  <br>&lt;time_precision&gt; variable attribute).  Whenever a time field (e.g., milliseconds
  <br>or seconds) is not shown, the absent value is assumed to be 0 (except for 
  <br>day-of-month, which is assumed to be 1).
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="consistentUnits">Consistent Units</a> - Using the same units for time
  ("seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z")
  <br>for all datasets allows times from different datasets to be compared easily. 
  <br>Seconds are the 
    <a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International 
      System of Units (SI)<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
    base unit of time.
  <br>1970-01-01T00:00:00Z is the start of the Unix epoch, which is widely used by computer 
  <br>operating systems.  "seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z" are widely used and are 
  <br>often called

    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
    or epoch seconds.  The use of the units string 
  <br>"seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z" makes Unix time compatible with
    <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2/udunits2.html"
      >UDUNITS-2<img

    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>,
    which uses UDUNITS-2 for units 
  <br>definitions.
  <br>&nbsp;
  
<li><a name="textRepresentation">Text Representation</a> - By default, when formatting times as
    text, ERDDAP uses the 
  <br><a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"
    >ISO 8601:2004 "extended" format String<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>, 
    truncated to the second 
  <br>(e.g., 2011-04-26T14:07:12Z).  (Related humor: 
    <a href="http://xkcd.com/1179/">http://xkcd.com/1179/<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>)
  <br>ERDDAP administrators can configure a given variable to display the time data values
  <br>to greater precision (truncated to 0.001 second, 0.01 second, 0.1 second)
  <br>or to lesser precision (truncated to second, minute, hour, date, or month)
  <br>to indicate the precision of the time data values.  
  <br>&nbsp;
  <br>When reading ISO 8601 times with decimal seconds, ERDDAP accepts a period separator
  <br>(e.g., 2011-04-26T14:07:12.059Z) or a comma separator (e.g., 2011-04-26T14:07:12,059Z).
  <br>Currently, when writing ISO 8601 times ERDDAP always uses a period separator.
  <br>&nbsp;
  
<li><a name="gregorianCalendar">Gregorian Calendar</a> -
  ERDDAP uses the Gregorian Calendar for times after the
  <br>discontinuity in 1582 and the Julian calendar for times before the discontinuity.
  <br>(The ISO 8601:2004 standard doesn''t specify how to handle times before 1582.)
  <br>See the
    <a rel="help" href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html"
      >Java GregorianCalendar class<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
    (which ERDDAP uses) for details.
  <br>For example, 17611992 hours since 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z = 2010-03-01T00:00:00Z
  <br>(<a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=17611992&amp;units=hours%20since%200001-01-01T00:00:00Z">see for yourself</a>)
  <br>&nbsp;
  <br>Currently, ERDDAP does not support any other calendar (including the noleap, 365_day,
  <br>360_day, and Julian calendars defined by the
    <a rel="help" href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html#calendar">CF metadata conventions<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>).  However, you 
  <br>can store such data in ERDDAP by storing the numbers or Strings in a variable that is
  <br>named something other than "time" and doesn''t include "since" in the units metadata.
  <br>Then, ERDDAP won''t interpret the values as times and won''t convert the data to 
  <br>"seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z". Users will be able to access the data in its 
  <br>original form.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="lenient">Lenient</a> - 
  ERDDAP is "lenient" when it parses date/time strings. That means
  <br>that date/times with the correct format, but with month, date, hour, minute,
  <br>and/or second values that are too large or too small will be rolled to the
  <br>appropriate date/times.  For example, ERDDAP interprets 2001-12-32 as
  <br>2002-01-01, and interprets 2002-01-00 as 2001-12-31.
  <br>(It''s not a bug, it''s a feature! We understand that you may object to this
  <br>if you are not familiar with lenient parsing. We understand there are 
  <br>circumstances where some people would prefer strict parsing, but there are also
  <br>circumstances where some people would prefer lenient parsing. ERDDAP can''t
  <br>have it both ways. This was a conscious choice. Lenient parsing is the default 
  <br>behavior in Java, the language that ERDDAP is written in and arguably the 
  <br>most-used computer language. Also, this behavior is consistent with ERDDAP''s 
  <br>conversion of requested grid axis values to the nearest valid grid axis value.
  <br>And this is consistent with some other places in ERDDAP that try to repair
  <br>invalid input when the intention is clear, instead of just returning an error
  <br>message.)

  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="BC">BC Years</a> - As specified in the ISO 8601:2004 standard, ERDDAP just uses the AD
  <br>(not the BC) era for year numbers.  The normal Julian sequence of years near the
  <br>era transition is 2 BC, 1 BC, 1 AD, 2 AD.  Because oceanographers and climatologists
  <br>often use year 0000 for climatologies, and because ISO 8601:2004 specifies this, the
  <br>years near the era transition in ERDDAP are -0001, 0000, 0001, 0002, respectively. 
  <br>Thus, for BC years: ERDDAPYear = 1 - BCYear (see for yourself: 
    <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=-1&amp;units=days%20since%200001-01-01">test1</a>, 
    <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=1985&amp;units=years%20since%200000-01-01">test2</a> and
    <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?n=-2&amp;units=years%20since%200000-01-01">test3</a>).
  <br>With that in mind, ERDDAP should work for dates far in the past and future.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="UTC">UTC</a> - As much as is practical, ERDDAP, like Unix time and UDUNITS-2, uses the 
  <br><a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal 
    Time (UTC)<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> 
    time system. UTC is the modern version of the GMT 
  <br>time system.  UTC uses occasional leap seconds to stay close to the International Atomic
  <br>Time (TAI). GPS devices use GPS time (which doesn''t use leap seconds) internally,
  <br>but display UTC time to users. (See 
    <a rel="help" href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html"
    >http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
    or other 
  <br>discussions of Systems of Time.) Strictly speaking, UTC can''t be used in some
  <br>situations for far future times (e.g., in models), since the occurrence of leap
  <br>seconds can''t be predicted. 
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="leapSeconds">Leap Seconds</a> - Like Unix time and UDUNITS-2, ERDDAP''s 
  <br>"seconds since 1970-00-00T00:00:00Z" is a numeric encoding (which doesn''t use leap
  <br>seconds) of UTC time (which does use leap seconds). When converting string times 
  <br>to/from numeric times, ERDDAP, like Unix time and UDUNITS-2, ignores leap seconds. 
  <br>Yet, ERDDAP, Unix time, and UDUNITS-2 numeric times all say they use UTC.  
  <br>Here''s why and how:
  <br>Since computer clocks are not good time keepers, they drift from UTC time and have
  <br>to be reset to UTC time occasionally. Unix time treats leap seconds as part of the time
  <br>deviation caused by the clock''s drift. This allows software to do time encoding and
  <br>time calculations and ignore leap seconds.  With ERDDAP, Unix time, and UDUNITS-2
  <br>numeric time values, all minutes are treated as having 60 seconds, even though UTC
  <br>minutes with leap seconds have 61 seconds.  Note that database programs like
    <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.sql4oracle.com/?p=504">Oracle<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>,
  <br>
    <a rel="bookmark" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/time-zone-leap-seconds.html"
      >MySQL<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
    (and so probably MariaDB also),
    <a rel="bookmark" href="http://postgresql-8.4.sourcearchive.com/documentation/8.4.0/pgtz_8c-source.html"
      >PostgreSQL<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>,
    and languages like 
     <a rel="bookmark" href="http://bytes.com/topic/c-sharp/answers/231842-datetime-accounts-leap-seconds"
       >C#<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
     also 
  <br>basically try to ignore leap seconds.
  <br>This won''t cause problems when converting UTC String date+time+timeZone values into
  <br>ERDDAP numeric values if the times are then reconverted back to date+time+Zulu
  <br>Strings in a way that also ignores leap seconds. The two errors will cancel each
  <br>other out. One unfortunate consequence is that ERDDAP, Unix time, and UDUNITS-2
  <br>numeric times have no mechanism to encode actual leap seconds as numbers
  <br>unambiguously. For example, both the leap second
    <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?isoTime=2008-12-31T23%3A59%3A60Z&amp;units=seconds+since+1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z">2008-12-31T23:59:60Z</a> and the 
  <br>next second
    <a href="{0}/convert/time.html?isoTime=2009-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z&amp;units=seconds+since+1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z">2009-01-01T00:00:00Z</a> are encoded as 
  <br>1230768000 seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.  This is a flaw, but only affects
  <br>actual leap seconds. Similarly, if you need to calculate the exact number of UTC
  <br>seconds between two points in time, you can use ERDDAP to handle the time data,
  <br>but subtracting one numeric time value from the other is just the first step in
  <br>the calculation.  You need manually adjust that value by consulting a
  <br><a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_seconds">table of leap seconds<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><a name="lowResolutionTimes">Low Resolution Times and Time Spans (Time Ranges)</a> - 
  If time data was recorded to
  <br>a lower resolution (e.g., a minute, hour, day, month, or year) or represents a time
  <br>span (e.g., a specific hour, day, 7-day period, month, year), ERDDAP requires that
  <br>a time point (we call it the "nominal time") be used to represent that time or time
  <br>span. Using a nominal time allows time points, low resolution time points, and time
  <br>spans to be interoperable. (Imagine visualizing different datasets in a program like 
  <br>Google Earth and using a time slider to control which subset of data is visible.) 
  <br>The most commonly selected time points for the nominal time are the start time and 
  <br>the centered time (less common, but has advantages for use with time sliders). We 
  <br>recommend that you use the long_name metadata to identify this (e.g., "Start Time" or 
  <br>"Centered Time"). For low resolution times, consider e.g., "Date", "Month", and "Year".
  <br>And/or, put the details in the variable''s "comment" metadata.
  <br>&nbsp;
  <br>Or, to more accurately represent time spans, you can set up a dataset to have both 
  <br>a beginTime and an endTime variable (and even a centeredTime, if you want
  <br>to cover all possibilities).
  <br>&nbsp;
  
<li><a name="imperfect">These are imperfect answers.</a> The current setup deals reasonably 
  well with most 
  <br>situations and matches most people''s expectations about how time works (even if they

<!-- The example on the first line is EDV.TIME_UNITS. -->
<convertTimeUnitsHelp><![CDATA[
For example, "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".
<p>The first word can be (upper or lower case):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;ms, msec, msecs, millis, millisecond, milliseconds,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;s, sec, secs, second, seconds,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;m, min, mins, minute, minutes,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;h, hr, hrs, hour, hours,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d, day, days,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;week, weeks,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;mon, mons, month, months,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;yr, yrs, year, or years.
<p>"since" is required.
<p>The time can be any time in the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ,
<br>where Z is 'Z' or a &plusmn;hh or &plusmn;hh:mm offset from the Zulu/GMT time zone.
<br>If you omit Z and the offset, the Zulu/GMT time zone is used.
<br>Separately, if you omit .sss, :ss.sss, :mm:ss.sss, or Thh:mm:ss.sss, the
<br>missing fields are assumed to be 0. 
<p>So another example is "hours since 0001-01-01".
<p>Technically, ERDDAP does NOT follow the UDUNITS standard when converting "years since"
<br>and "months since" time values to "seconds since". The UDUNITS standard defines a
<br>year as a fixed, single value: 3.15569259747e7 seconds. And UDUNITS defines a month
<br>as year/12. Unfortunately, most/all datasets that we have seen that use 
<br>"years since" or "months since" clearly intend the values to be calendar years
<br>or calendar months. For example, "3 months since 1970-01-01" is usually intended
<br>to mean 1970-04-01. So, ERDDAP interprets "years since" and "months since" as
<br>calendar years and months, and does not strictly follow the UDUNITS standard.

<filesDocumentation><![CDATA[
ERDDAP's "files" system lets you browse a virtual file system and download 
source
<br>data files. Hopefully, this is a familiar, easy system that you can use with your
<br>favorite web browser or, if you prefer, from a command line program like 
  <a rel="help" href="#curl">curl</a>.

<p>ERDDAP was designed around the idea that most datasets are huge, so most users
<br>just need or want a subset of the dataset that they are interested in (e.g., a smaller <br>geographic area, a smaller time range, or not all of the data variables). But we 
<br>understand that some users actually do want an entire dataset, or at least the subset
<br>which is found in a subset of the source data files.  If that's you, then the "files"
<br>system may be for you. One advantage of the "files" system is that you can see each
<br>file's Last Modified time (Zulu time zone), so it is easy to see if a file has been
<br>changed.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>Click</h3>
To use the "files" system, just click. On any "files" web page, you can:
<ul>
<li>Click on a heading (Name, Last modified, Size, or Description) to sort the items
  <br>by that attribute. Clicking repeatedly on one heading toggles the sort order <br>(ascending or descending).  Note that "Last modified" uses the Zulu time zone.
<li>Click on a directory name to go to that directory. 
<li>Click on a file name to download that file.
  <br>&nbsp;
</ul>

<h3><font class="warningColor"><a name="warning">WARNING!</a></font> Different Metadata and Variable Names</h3>
For datasets available via ERDDAP's tabledap or griddap, ERDDAP administrators
<br>can set up ERDDAP to change a dataset's metadata and variable names on-the-fly 
<br>so that you, the user, see an improved version of the dataset's metadata. But in
<br>"files", you will see the original metadata and variable names, so don't be surprised
<br>if they are different! If you aren't comfortable dealing with the different metadata
<br>and variable names, you might prefer using the dataset's Data Access Form instead.

<p>Similarly, when you request a subset of data from one of ERDDAP's Data Access Forms, 
<br>you can specify the file type (e.g., .nc, .csv, .json, .mat) that you want to receive in
<br>response. Naturally, the source data files available via "files" are just available in
<br>one file type. If you aren't happy with the source file's file type, you might prefer
<br>using the dataset's Data Access Forms instead.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a name="notAllDatasets">Not All Datasets</a></h3>
Some datasets in this ERDDAP aren't available via the "files" system. Common reasons
<br>include:
<ul>
<li>The dataset's data doesn't come from files (e.g., it comes from a database
  <br>or Cassandra, or from a remote ERDDAP, THREDDS, or GRADS data server).
<li>The immediate source files are .ncml files which specify how to modify the
  <br>actual data files on-the-fly.
<li>The ERDDAP administrator chose not to make the source data files available.
</ul>
If the source files for a dataset that you want aren't available, you can email 
<br>the administrator of this ERDDAP, &adminEmail;,
<br>to request that they be made available, but there is usually a reason why they aren't
<br>already available.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a name="notFtp">Not FTP</a></h3>
We understand that some users might prefer that ERDDAP offer files via FTP instead
<br>of HTTP as is done by "files". Sorry. Hopefully, you'll be able to do what you need
<br>to do with the current "files" system.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a name="curl">Command Line Downloads with curl</a></h3>
If you want to download a series of files from ERDDAP, you don't have to request each
<br>file's ERDDAP URL in your browser, sitting and waiting for each file to download. If
<br>you are comfortable writing computer programs (e.g., with C, Java, Python, Matlab, r)
<br>you can write a program with a loop that imports all of the desired data files. Or, if
<br>you are comfortable with command line programs (just running a program, or using bash
<br>or tcsh scripts in Linux or Mac OS X, or batch files in Windows), you can use curl to
<br>save results files from ERDDAP into files on your hard drive, without using a browser 
<br>or writing a computer program. ERDDAP+curl is amazingly powerful and allows you to 
<br>use ERDDAP in many new ways.
<br>On Linux and Mac OS X, curl is probably already installed as /usr/bin/curl.
<br>On Windows, or if your computer doesn't have curl already, you need to 
  <a rel="bookmark" href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">download curl<img
    src="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
<br>and install it.  To get to a command line in Windows, click on "Start" and type 
<br>"cmd" into the search textfield.
<br>("Win32 - Generic, Win32, binary (without SSL)" worked for me in Windows 7.)
<br><b>Please be kind to other ERDDAP users: run just one script or curl command at a time.</b>

<p>Instructions for using curl are on the

    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
<br>But here is a quick tutorial related to using curl with ERDDAP:
<ul>
<li>To download and save one file, use 
  <br><tt>curl -g "<i>erddapUrl</i>" -o <i>fileDir/fileName.ext</i></tt>
  <br>where <tt>-g</tt> disables curl's globbing feature,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><i>erddapUrl</i></tt> is any ERDDAP URL that requests a data or image file, and
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>-o <i>fileDir/fileName.ext</i></tt> specifies the name for the file that will be created.
  <br>For example,
<pre>curl -g "http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/files/cwwcNDBCMet/NDBC_41004_met.nc" -o ndbc/41004.nc</pre>
The erddapUrl must be <a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">percent encoded<img
    src="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>:
  <br>all characters in parameter values (the parts after '=' signs) other than A-Za-z0-9_-!.~'()*
  <br>must be encoded as %HH, where HH is the 2 digit hexadecimal value of the character, for example,
  <br>a space becomes %20. Characters above #127 must be converted to UTF-8 bytes, then each UTF-8
  <br>byte must be percent encoded (ask a programmer for help). There are
  <br><a rel="help" href="http://www.url-encode-decode.com/">web sites that percent encode and decode for you<img 
    src="../images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>. 
  <br>If you get the URL from your browser's address textfield, this may be already done.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>To download and save many files in one step, use curl with the globbing feature
  <br>enabled:
  <br><tt>curl "<i>erddapUrl</i>" -o <i>fileDir/fileName#1.ext</i></tt>
  <br>Since the globbing feature treats the characters [, ], {, and } as special, you must also
  <br><a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">percent encode<img
    src="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)"
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> 
    them in the erddapURL as &#37;5B, &#37;5D, &#37;7B, &#37;7D, respectively.
  <br>Fortunately, these are almost never in "files" file names.
  <br>Then, in the erddapUrl, replace a zero-padded number (for example <tt>01</tt>) with a 
  <br>range of values (for example, <tt>[01-15]</tt> ), or replace a substring (for example <br><tt>41004</tt>) with a list of values (for example, <tt>{41004,41009,41010}</tt> ).
  <br>The <tt>#1</tt> within the output fileName causes the current value of the range or 
  <br>list to be put into the output fileName. For example, 
<pre>curl "http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/files/cwwcNDBCMet/NDBC_{41004,41009,41010}_met.nc" -o ndbc/#1.nc</pre>
</ul>

<functions>Server-side Functions</functions>

<functionHtml><![CDATA[
TableDAP supports some server-side functions that modify the data results table.
<br>They are <b>optional</b>.  Other than 'distinct()', they are <b>rarely needed</b>.
<p>Currently, each of the functions takes the results table as input and
<br>returns the table with the same columns in the same order, but the
<br>order of the rows, the number of rows, or data on the rows, is altered.
<br>If you use more than one function, they will be applied in the order
<br>that they appear in the request.
]]></functionHtml>

<functionDistinctCheck>Check this if you want to use the distinct() function.</functionDistinctCheck>

<functionDistinctHtml><![CDATA[
Checking 'distinct()' tells ERDDAP to sort the results table by all of the
<br>variables selected above (with the top/first variable selected above
<br>being the most important and other selected variables only being used
<br>to break ties) and to remove all duplicate rows from the response table.
<p>WARNING: if this is used without constraints, ERDDAP may have to read
<br>all rows from the datasource, which can be VERY SLOW for some datasets.
<br>So you should usually include constraints (e.g., time minimum and maximum).
]]></functionDistinctHtml>


<functionOrderByHtml><![CDATA[
<p>The orderBy... functions let you specify how the results table will be sorted and which rows will be kept.
<br>To use an orderBy... function, select a function at left, then select one or more variables at right.
<br>To not use any orderBy... function, set all of the variables at right to "".
<br>The orderBy... functions are:
<ul>
<li>orderBy lets you specify how the results table will be sorted and keeps all rows.
<li>orderByMax lets you specify how the results table will be sorted and removes some rows.
 <br>Within each group, only the row with the maximum value for the last orderByMax variable will be kept.
 <br>For example, orderByMax("stationID, time") will sort by stationID, but only return the row with 
 <br>the maximum time value for each stationID.
<li>orderByMin is like orderByMax, but only keeps the row with the minimum value for the last orderByMin
 <br>variable.
<li>orderByMinMax is like orderByMin plus orderByMax.
 <br>Within each group, only the row with the minimum value and the row with the maximum value for the 
 <br>last orderByMinMax variable will be kept.
 <br>For example, orderByMinMax("stationID, time") will return the row with the minimum time value and
 <br>the row with the maximum time value for each stationID.
</ul>

<!-- When possible (and it isn't always possible), ERDDAP breaks data requests
into chunks to conserve memory.

With 32 bit Java, in a simplistic sense, the maximum number of simultaneous
*large* requests is roughly 3/4 of the memory available
(the -Xmx value passed to Tomcat) divided by the chunk size
(e.g., 1200 MB / 100 MB => 12 requests).
Other things require memory, so the actual number of requests will be less.
In practice, chunking isn't always possible.
So one huge or a few very large simultaneous non-chunkable requests
could cause problems on 32 bit Java.

With 64 bit Java, the -Xmx value can be much larger. So memory is much less
likely to be a constraint.

You can override the default chunk size by defining these tags in setup.xml
(not here in messges.xml) and changing the values from the defaults shown here:
  For grids:  <partialRequestMaxBytes>100000000</partialRequestMaxBytes>
  For tables: <partialRequestMaxCells>100000</partialRequestMaxCells>

partialRequestMaxBytes is the preferred maximum number of bytes for a partial
grid data request (a chunk of the total request). Recommended = 100000000  (10^8).
Larger sizes aren't necessarily better (and don't go over 500 MB because that is
THREDD's limit for DAP responses). But larger sizes may require fewer accesses of
tons of files (think of ERD's satellite data with each time point
in a separate file - it's better to get more data from each file
in each partial request).

partialRequestMaxCells is the preferred maximum number of cells
(nRows * nColumns in the data table) for a partial TABLE data request
(a chunk of the total request).  Default = 100000.
Larger sizes aren't necessarily better. They result in a longer wait for the
initial batch of data from the source.

<h2><font class="highlightColor"><i>Easier Access to Scientific Data</i></font></h2>
Our focus is on making it easier for you to get scientific data.

<p><font class="highlightColor"><b>Different scientific communities have developed different types of data servers,</b></font>
<br>for example, OPeNDAP, WCS, SOS, OBIS, and countless custom web pages with forms.
Each is great on its own.
Without ERDDAP, it is difficult to get data from different types of servers:
<ul>
<li>Different data servers make you format your data request in different ways.
<li>Different data servers return data in different formats, usually not the common file format that you want.
<li>Different datasets use different formats for time data, so the results are hard to compare.
</ul>

<!-- We believe that by focusing on your needs, ERDDAP can make it easier to get data.
make it easier for you to get scientific data.-->

<p><font class="highlightColor"><b>ERDDAP unifies the different types of data servers
  so you have a consistent way to get the data you want, in the format you want.</b></font>
<ul>
<li><b>ERDDAP acts as a middleman between you and various remote data servers.</b>
  <br>When you request data from ERDDAP,
  ERDDAP reformats the request into the format required by the remote server,
  sends the request to the remote server, gets the data, reformats the data into the
  format that you requested, and sends the data to you.
  You no longer have to go to different data servers to get data from different datasets.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b>ERDDAP offers an easy-to-use, consistent way to request data: via the OPeNDAP standard.</b>
&wmsManyDatasets;
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b>ERDDAP returns data in the common file format of your choice.</b>
  <br>ERDDAP offers all data as .html table, ESRI .asc and .csv, Google Earth .kml, 
    OPeNDAP binary, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .csv, .tsv, .json, and .xhtml.
    So you no longer have to waste time and effort reformatting data.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b>ERDDAP can also return a .png or .pdf image with a customized graph or map.</b>
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b>ERDDAP standardizes the dates+times in the results.</b>
  <br>Data from other data servers is hard to compare
    because the dates+times often are expressed in different formats
    (for example, "Jan 2, 1985", 2 Jan 85, 02-JAN-1985, 1/2/85, 2/1/85,
    1985-01-02, "days since Jan 1, 1900").
  <br>For string times, ERDDAP always uses the ISO 8601:2004(E) standard format, for example, 1985-01-02T00:00:00Z.
  <br>For numeric times, ERDDAP always uses "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".
  <br>ERDDAP always uses the Zulu (UTC, GMT) time zone to remove the difficulties
    of working with different time zones and standard time vs. daylight saving time.
&convertTimeReference;  
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b>ERDDAP has web pages (for humans with browsers) and 
     <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/rest.html">RESTful&nbsp;web&nbsp;services</a> 
     (for computer programs).</b>
  <br>You can bypass ERDDAP's web pages and use ERDDAP's RESTful web services 
    (for example, for searching for datasets, for downloading data, for making maps)
    directly from any computer program (for example, Matlab, R, or a program that you write)
    and even from web pages (via HTML image tags or JavaScript).  
</ul>

<p><b><a rel="help" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18xZoXu1USM">For a quick introduction to ERDDAP,
  watch the first half of this

<p><b>Data Providers: You can
  <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html">set up your own ERDDAP server</a>
  and serve your own data.</b>
<br>ERDDAP is free and open source. It uses Apache-like licenses, so you can do anything you want with it.
ERDDAP's appearance is customizable, so your ERDDAP will reflect your institution, not NOAA. 
The small effort to set up ERDDAP brings many benefits.
If you already have a web service for distributing your data,
you can set up ERDDAP to access your data via the existing service
or via the source files or database.
Then, people will have another way to access your data
and will be able to download the data in additional file formats
or as graphs or maps.
ERDDAP has been installed by over 50 organizations worldwide.
<a rel="bookmark"
href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=Data_Access_Technical_Recommendations#Software_implementations">NOAA's Data Access Procedural Directive</a>

<h2><a name="problems">The Problems</a> that ERDDAP Tries To Solve</h2>
Without ERDDAP, when a person (or a computer program) looks on the Internet for a
specific type of scientific data (for example, satellite sea surface temperature data),
there are problems ...
<ul>
<li>Interesting datasets are hard to find because they are at many different web sites.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Each site requires a different protocol to request the data
  &requestFormatExamplesHtml;.
  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Each site returns the data in a different format (for example, XML, SOAP+XML, OPeNDAP binary
  data stream, ASCII text, HDF 4, HDF 5, NetCDF, ...) and it isn't the common file format
  that you want.

  <br>&nbsp;
<li>Data from different sites is hard to compare because the dates+times are expressed in
  different formats for example, "Jan 2, 1985", "02-JAN-1985", "1/2/85", "2/1/85",
  "1985-01-02", or days since Jan 1, 1980, or ...).

<li><b><a name="localAndRemote">ERDDAP</a> can get data from local (on the server's hard drive) and

    that ERDDAP can access.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="scientificData">ERDDAP</a> can serve many types of scientific data, not just oceanographic data.</b>
  <br>ERDDAP is a data server that was written at

    The ERDDAP server at ERD serves oceanographic data,
    but ERDDAP (the program) can access and serve any gridded or tabular data.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="search">ERDDAP</a> offers several ways to search for interesting datasets.</b>
  <br>For example,
  <a href="&erddapUrl;/search/index.html">full text search</a>,
  <a href="&erddapUrl;/categorize/index.html">search by category</a> 
  (also known as faceted search), and
  <a href="&erddapUrl;/search/advanced.html">Advanced Search</a>.
  Advanced Search combines all of the search techniques
  and adds searches for datasets that have data within longitude, latitude, and time ranges,
  so you can search for datasets based on many different criteria simultaneously.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="standardizedRequests">ERDDAP</a> lets you request data in a standardized way,</b>
<br>regardless of the data source's request protocol.
  <ul>
  <li>ERDDAP makes gridded data available via griddap
    (ERDDAP's implementation of the
      <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/index.html">OPeNDAP hyperslab protocol</a>)
      and <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/wms/index.html">WMS</a>.
  <li>ERDDAP makes tabular data available via tabledap
    (ERDDAP's implementation of the
      <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/index.html">OPeNDAP constraint protocol</a>) and

  requests. <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.opendap.org">OPeNDAP's<img

    (OPeNDAP is great!)
  ERDDAP translates your request from the OPeNDAP, WMS, or SOS format to the data source's
  request format and converts the response to one of ERDDAP's internal data structures.
  Then ERDDAP reformats the data in the common file format of your choice (for example, as an
  .html table, ESRI .asc, Google Earth .kml, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .csv, .tsv, .json, .xhtml, .png, .pdf)
  and sends the file to you.
  See the list of 
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/documentation.html#fileType">griddap file types</a>
  and the list of 
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/documentation.html#fileType">tabledap file types</a>.
  Other protocols for requesting the data (for example,
    <a rel="help" href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs">WCS<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>)
    may be added in the future.
  ERDDAP is structured for these additions and there don't seem to be any impediments.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="userUnits">Requests</a> for gridded data can be made in user units.</b>
  <br>Although requests for gridded data in ERDDAP can be made with array indices
  (following the OPeNDAP specification), requests can also be in user units
  (for example, degrees east), using
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/documentation.html#parentheses">a parentheses notation</a>,
  since users think in those units,
  not indices.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="fileFormats">ERDDAP</a> sends results in common data file formats.</b>
  <br>The results can be returned in any of several common data file formats
  &resultsFormatExamplesHtml;,
  instead of just the original format or just the OPeNDAP transfer format (which has no
  standard file manifestation). These files are created on-the-fly.
  Since there are few internal data structures, it is easy to add additional file-type drivers.
  See the complete list of 
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/documentation.html#fileType">grid file types</a>
  and <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/documentation.html#fileType">table file types</a>.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="LLAT">ERDDAP</a> standardizes the variable names and units for longitude, latitude, altitude,
  depth, and time in the results.</b>
  <br>To facilitate comparisons of data from different datasets, the requests and results in ERDDAP
  use standardized space/time axis units:
  <ul>
  <li>longitude is always in degrees_east.
  <li>latitude is always in degrees_north.
  <li>altitude is always in meters with positive=up.
  <li>depth is always in meters with positive=down.
  <li>time, when formatted as a number, is always in "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    (known as <a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> or epoch seconds,
    which is
      <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/"
      >UDUNITS<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>-compatible)
      and, when formatted as a string, is formatted according
    to the
      <a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601:2004 "extended" format<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
      standard <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ,</span> for example,
      <span style="white-space: nowrap;">"1985-01-02T00:00:00Z").</span>
    (You can convert numeric times to/from ISO string times with ERDDAP's
      <a rel="bookmark" href="&erddapUrl;/convert/time.html">time converter</a>.)
    Also, to avoid time zone and daylight savings time confusion, time values are always
    converted to the Zulu (UTC, GMT) time zone.
  </ul>
  This makes it easy to specify constraints in requests without having to worry about the altitude
  data format (are positive values up or down? in meters or fathoms?) or the time data format
  (a nightmarish realm of possible formats, for example, "Jan 2, 1985",
  "02-JAN-1985", "1/2/85", "2/1/85", "1985-01-02", or days since Jan 1, 1980).
  This makes the results from different data sources easy to compare.

  <p>ERDDAP has a utility to 
  <a rel="bookmark" href="&erddapUrl;/convert/time.html">Convert a Numeric Time to/from a String Time</a>.
  <br>For more details, see 
  <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/convert/time.html#erddap">How ERDDAP Deals with Time</a>.

  <p>Because the longitude, latitude, altitude, and time variables are specifically recognized,
  ERDDAP is aware of the geo/temporal features of each dataset.
  This is useful when making images with maps or time-series, and when saving data
  in geo-referenced file types (e.g., .esriAscii, .geoJson, and .kml).

  <p>Two common standards for writing units of measure are:
  <ul>
  <li><a rel="help" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/">UDUNITS<img

    often refer to UCUM as UOM (Units Of Measure). For example, UCUM has just one
    case-sensitive option for degrees Celsius: "Cel".
    <br>&nbsp;
  </ul>
  Although ERDDAP doesn't require the use of either units standard, most ERDDAP installations
  favor one or the other.
  (ERDDAP administrators: you can specify this with the <tt>&lt;units_standard&gt;</tt> 
  tag in setup.xml.)
  You can convert UDUNITS to/from UCUM units with ERDDAP's

  When you request data or a graph from a <a href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/index.html">tabledap dataset</a>,
      you can append <tt>&amp;units("UDUNITS")</tt>
  or <tt>&amp;units("UCUM")</tt> to the end of the URL to request UDUNITS or UCUM units.

<li><b><a name="compression">Requesting Compressed Files</a></b>
  <br>ERDDAP doesn't offer results stored in compressed (e.g., .zip or .gzip) files.
  Instead, ERDDAP looks for
  <a rel="help" href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/"
    >accept-encoding<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
     in the HTTP GET request header sent by the client.
  If a supported compression type ("gzip", "x-gzip", or "deflate") is found in the
  accept-encoding list, ERDDAP includes "content-encoding" in the HTTP response header
  and compresses the data as it transmits it.
  It is up to the client program to look for "content-encoding" and decompress the data.
  Browsers and OPeNDAP clients do this by default. They request compressed data and
  decompress the returned data automatically.
  Other clients (e.g., Java programs) have to do this explicitly.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="interoperable">ERDDAP</a>
    makes different types of data servers (OPeNDAP, OBIS, SOS, WMS, ...) interoperable.</b>
  <br>Different types of data servers are used in different scientific communities.
  In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that any one type will become dominant and
  replace the others. So ERDDAP acts as a bridge between different types of
  client programs (web browsers, IDV, Matlab, netCDF programs, ODV, WMS clients, etc.)
  and the different types of data servers.
  <ol>
  <li>ERDDAP accepts client requests for data in different formats (e.g., OPeNDAP, WMS).
  <li>ERDDAP converts a given request into the request format used by the source data server
    (e.g., OPeNDAP, SOS, OBIS, ...) and sends that to the source data server.
  <li>ERDDAP converts the response data from the source data server into an internal format,
    including converting all time data to a common format: "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z".
  <li>ERDDAP converts the data from the internal format into the file format requested by the client
    (e.g., .csv, Google Earth .kml, .htmlTable, .dods, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .png).
  </ol>
  Clients don't have to worry about, or know about, the type of the source data server.
  They just get the data they want, in the file format they want.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="dataStructures">ERDDAP</a> uses just two basic data structures to hold data.</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Since it is difficult for human clients and computer clients to deal with a complex set of
    possible dataset structures, ERDDAP uses just two basic data structures:
    <ul>
    <li>a <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/griddap/documentation.html#dataModel">gridded data structure</a>
      (for example, for satellite data and model data) and
    <li>a <a rel="help" href="&erddapUrl;/tabledap/documentation.html#dataModel">tabular data structure</a>
      (for example, for in-situ buoy, station, and trajectory data).
    </ul>
  <li>Certainly, not all data can be expressed in these structures, but much of it can.
    Tables, in particular, are very flexible data structures (look at the phenomenal success
    of
      <a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">relational database<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a> programs).
  <li>This makes data queries easier to construct.
  <li>This makes data responses have a simple structure, which makes it easier to serve the data
    in a wider variety of standard file types (which often just support simple data structures).
    This is the main reason that we set up ERDDAP this way.
  <li>This, in turn, makes it very easy for us (or anyone) to write client software which works
    with all ERDDAP datasets.
  <li>This makes it easier to compare data from different sources, for example for an
    Integrated Ecosystem Analysis (IEA).
  <li>We are very aware that if you are used to working with data in other data structures
    you may initially think that this approach is simplistic or insufficient.
    But all data structures have tradeoffs. None is perfect.
    Even the do-it-all structures have their downsides: working with them is complex and
    the files can only be written or read with special software libraries.
    If you accept ERDDAP's approach enough to try to work with it, you may find that it has
    its advantages (notably the support for multiple file types that can hold the data responses).
    The  
    <a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfel.noaa.gov/erddap/images/erddapTalk/erddapTechTalk.html">original ERDDAP slide show</a>

    structures slide</a>)
    talks about these issues.
  <li>And even if this approach sounds odd to you, most ERDDAP clients will never notice --
    they will simply see that all of the datasets have a nice simple structure and they will
    be thankful that they can get data from a wide variety of sources returned in a wide
    variety of file formats.

  <p><b>Comparison</b>
    The RSS service may be just what you are looking for.  It is a nice standard.
    But if you need to know as soon as possible when a dataset changes, use the
    email/URL system, not RSS. RSS clients periodically (every hour?) request and read
    the RSS XML document to look for changes.
    So typically, an RSS client will not detect a change to a dataset quickly (average 30 minutes?).
    In contrast, the email/URL subscription system acts immediately whenever ERDDAP detects
    a change to a dataset.
    The more pro-active approach of the email/URL system is also much more efficient:
    You may be able to set your RSS client to check for changes every minute (don't do it!),
    but that would just lead to lots of unnecessary requests to the ERDDAP server
    and it still wouldn't detect changes immediately.

<li><b><a name="security">Security</a></b> - By default, ERDDAP runs as an entirely public server with no login
  system and no restrictions to data access.
  However, an ERDDAP administrator can configure ERDDAP to restrict access to some
  or all datasets to users who log in and have been assigned certain roles.
  ERDDAP has built-in methods for authentication (logging in).
  If an ERDDAP installation has authentication turned on, there will be a "log in" link
  at the top of each web page.
  Users never have to log in to access the publicly available datasets.
  Users who have logged in can access public datasets and the private datasets to which
  they are allowed access.
  Users must use https: (Secure Sockets Layer) to log in and to access private datasets.
  Datasets can configured to have graphs and maps publicly accessible, 
    but have data only accessible to authorized users.

  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="chunks">ERDDAP</a> processes data in chunks.</b>
  <br>To save memory (a big issue) and make responses start sooner, ERDDAP processes
  data requests in chunks -- repeatedly getting a chunk of data from the source,
  cleaning it up (for example, adding
    <a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>),
    and sending that to the client.
  For many data sources, this means that the first chunk of data (for example, from the
  first sensor) gets to the client in seconds instead of minutes (for example, after data
  from the last sensor has been retrieved), reassuring the client that the data is coming.
  From a memory standpoint, this allows numerous large requests (each larger than available
  memory) to be handled simultaneously.
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="modular">ERDDAP</a> has a modular structure.</b>
  <br>ERDDAP is structured so that it is easy to add different components
  (for example, a class to request data from a SOS server and store it as a table).
  The new component then gains all the features and capabilities of the parent
  (for example, support for OPeNDAP requests and the ability to save the data in several
  common file formats).
  <br>&nbsp;

<li><b><a name="pushPull">Data Dissemination / Data Distribution Networks: Push and Pull Technology</a></b>
<br>Normally, ERDDAP acts as an intermediary: it takes a request from a user;
gets data from a remote data source; reformats the data; and sends it to the user.
<a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_technology">Pull Technology<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>:
But ERDDAP also has the ability to actively get all of the available data
from a remote data source and
<a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridCopy">store
a local copy of the data</a>.

      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>:
By using ERDDAP's <a href="#subscriptions">subscription services</a>,
other data servers can be notified
as soon as new data is available so that they can request the data (by pulling the data).
ERDDAP's
<a rel="help"  href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDGridFromErddap">EDDGridFromErddap</a> and <a rel="help"  href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setupDatasetsXml.html#EDDTableFromErddap">EDDTableFromErddap</a> use ERDDAP's subscription services and
<a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#flag">flag system</a>
so that they will be notified immediately when new data is available.
You can combine these to great effect:
if you wrap an EDDGridCopy around an EDDGridFromErddap dataset
(or wrap an EDDTableCopy around an EDDTableFromErddap dataset),
ERDDAP will automatically create and maintain a local copy of another ERDDAP's dataset.
Because the subscription services work as soon as new data is available,
push technology disseminates data very quickly (within seconds).

<p>This architecture puts each ERDDAP administrator in charge of determining where the data
for his/her ERDDAP comes from. Other ERDDAP administrators can do the same.
There is no need for coordination between administrators.
If many ERDDAP administrators link to each other's ERDDAPs,
a data distribution network is formed.
Data will be quickly, efficiently, and automatically disseminated from data sources
(ERDDAPs and other servers) to data re-distribution sites (ERDDAPs) anywhere in the network.
A given ERDDAP can be both a source of data for some datasets and a re-distribution site
for other datasets.
The resulting network is roughly similar to data distribution networks set up with programs
like
   <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idd/">Unidata's IDD/IDM<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)"

   but less rigidly structured.
<br>&nbsp;

</ul>


<p><b><a name="sweetSpot">Is</a> ERDDAP a solution to everyone's data distribution / data access problems?</b>
<br>No. ERDDAP tries to find a sweet spot that is a really good solution to most of the
data distribution problems that we confronted.
ERDDAP takes a middleware approach:
It can get data from lots of different types of remote data servers
and it can give that data to clients in lots of different file formats.
It is designed to be an agnostic solution which seeks to make other data servers
(OPeNDAP, SOS, OBIS, WMS, ...) interoperable.
Is there one perfect data server that meets everyone's needs perfectly?  We don't think so.
And even if you think there is or will be, it will be a long time before everyone switches
to it, if ever. Until then, ERDDAP is available right now to make other data servers
interoperable and to serve data right now.

<p><a name="complexDatasets">ERDDAP</a> can handle many/most datasets as is, but not all.
It isn't that the remaining datasets (e.g., model data using a cubed sphere projection)
aren't important.  It's just that ERDDAP's goal of returning data in common file formats
(some of which are pretty simple), precludes a more complex internal data structure.
Groups of researchers working with more complex data structures often already have specialized
data servers and specialized client software which are customized to their community's needs.
ERDDAP, as a general purpose data server, doesn't try to compete with these specialized data servers.
They are customized to the needs of their community and do a great job.
However, those datasets are often only "understood" by the specialized software in that community.

<p>A Work-Around for Complex Datasets - ERDDAP has a way to handle complex datasets that it
can't handle directly. Just as a
<a rel="help" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system"
  >relational database<img 
      src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
      title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>
can store a complex dataset by using just
one simple data structure (a table), ERDDAP can serve the data from more complex datasets by
breaking the source dataset into a few ERDDAP datasets, each with similar, simple data structures.
For example, some gridded environmental model datasets can be stored in ERDDAP by
putting the sea surface variables ([time][latitude][longitude]) in one ERDDAP dataset,
and by putting the variables with altitude ([time][altitude][latitude][longitude])
in another ERDDAP dataset. We know this isn't ideal, but it is necessary to allow ERDDAP
to return data in common file formats (some of which are pretty simple).

<p>Another approach to dealing with complex datasets (e.g., for model data using a cubed
sphere projection) is to also offer a reprojected version of the dataset
([time][altitude][latitude][longitude]) which ERDDAP can work with easily.
These simpler data structures aren't meant to replace the original data structures,
but they can be a useful way to distribute the data to a wider audience.


<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="sustainable"><b>How sustainable is the ERDDAP project?</b></a>
<br>ERDDAP is very sustainable.
<br>Some people are surprised and disappointed to hear that ERDDAP is mostly
developed by one person (me, Bob Simons). 
[By the way, the opinions on this web page are my personal opinions and 
do not necessarily reflect any position of the 
Government or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.]
They fear that if something happens
to me, that will be end of ERDDAP. That is simply not true. 
ERDDAP's positioning for long-term sustainability is excellent, 
perhaps the best it could possibly be.

<p>Yes, I am the main developer of ERDDAP. I am a fully funded federal employee. 
My funding isn't "soft" money, so I don't receive or rely on grants.
I spend more than half my time developing ERDDAP. 
The rest of my time is spent managing datasets. 
That work is useful for ERDDAP because I need to work with real datasets in order to
know in detail what ERDDAP needs to do. My bosses fully support my work on
ERDDAP because it does what I was hired to do: make it easier for fisheries
scientists (primarily, but really everyone) to get scientific data from diverse
sources.

<p><a name="miraculous">The miraculous</a>
thing about software is that it costs nothing to duplicate. 
So to do my job, I write ERDDAP for use at ERD. I think that is the best possible way
for me to do my job. That reason alone justifies the
expense of developing ERDDAP. (I think it could be shown that ERDDAP has saved
more NOAA scientist's time than that I have spent developing ERDDAP. Time=Money.)
But the side benefit is that any other organization can 
<a rel="bookmark" 
href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html">download, install, and use ERDDAP</a>
<b>for free</b> to distribute their scientific data.  
<br><a rel="bookmark" 
href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#organizations">Over 50 organizations around the world use ERDDAP</a>. Maybe there is such a thing as a free lunch.

<p>ERDDAP is a Java program. The source code
for every version is on 
<a rel="bookmark" href="https://github.com/BobSimons">GitHub<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>,
the most commonly used system for collaborative
software projects. One person in France has also contributed code (thank you!).
I hope others will contribute code in the future.
If something happens to me, my bosses will hire a replacement with the specific goal that
s/he continue the development of ERDDAP.
Further, I try to write very clean code. I write Java Doc comments. I write
comments in the code. I chose variable names carefully. I follow the Java formatting guidelines.
All of this is an effort
to make the code more readable, for other programmers who want to understand
and/or change it, and for me, because, in a year or two, I will have forgotten
the details of how and why the code was written the way it was.  
Clean code with good comments makes my ongoing work on ERDDAP easier, so I have a
great incentive to write clean code with good comments.

<p><a name="FOSS">But</a> all of my answers so far are not very important. 
Only one thing that is really important. Only one thing guarantees sustainability
for ERDDAP or any software project: that ERDDAP is 
<a rel="bookmark" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>.
Specifically, ERDDAP uses 
<a rel="bookmark" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache-compatible software licenses<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>,
so anyone can do anything they want with the code.

<p>Why is that important? One might think that software will be reliably available 
in the future because a big 
company is behind it. But Google, for example, has discontinued numerous projects 
(<a rel="bookmark"
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services">here's a list<img 
    src="&erddapUrl;/images/external.png" align="bottom" alt=" (external link)" 
    title="This link to an external web site does not constitute an endorsement."/></a>).
I don't want to pick on Google because I really like Google and they 
fund a large number of great, open-source projects. Microsoft has
discontinued projects. Apple has discontinued projects. ... 
The point is that just having the backing of a large company is no assurance
that the project will continue.
The users of that software are out of luck, 
<b>unless</b> the software was (and therefore, is) Free and Open Source Software 
(FOSS). Then, whenever there is interest by even one developer, the project can and will 
continue to evolve. FOSS is an insurance policy. In fact, FOSS is the only
insurance policy, the only assurance, that matters. FOSS insures that the there
is always a way forward for the software. That is a right that no one can 
take away, ever. 

<p><a name="largeTeam">One</a> might also think that software that has a large team of developers 
will be more sustainable than software with one main developer. But 
lots of developers usually need lots of funding. I know a famous, reasonably 
large project with 10 developers (I won't embarrass them by naming them) that is
in constant serious danger of stopping the project because they don't have
enough funding. They rely on grants. They always run a deficit. Their patron always bails them 
out at the last minute, but is getting really tired of bailing them out. 
So if they can't raise a million dollars a year in grant money 
(or the patron gets too tired of bailing them out), they'll stop. And the group can't 
conceive of having fewer than 10 developers. Each developer has a role to play
in their group. In light of that, it seems to me that it is a great sign 
that ERDDAP can be, and is, actively developed by just one person (who is
fully funded). If fact, it would be a bad sign if ERDDAP required multiple
developers. That ERDDAP has just one developer means that it isn't a huge 
task that requires massive ongoing funding; it is a relatively small task 
that requires minimal effort and funding. That is more sustainable, not less.

<p><a name="contractingCompany">One</a> might think that hiring a contracting company 
to write software is
a good idea. For a fee, they'll provide developers and promise continuity (which
is good unless/until they go out of business). But they 
also have you over a barrel: you must pay them what they request or there is
no more development, <b>unless</b> the software is FOSS and you're just paying them
to work on the code. With FOSS, you always have choices about how to move forward.
Because ERDDAP is FOSS, contractors are always a good option for you or anyone
with regard to ERDDAP: if anything happens to me, or if I don't have time to
make some change that you want, or I retire and you don't like my replacement's work, 
you can always hire a contracting company to make the changes you want (or make them yourself). 

<p><a name="sustainabilitySummary">In summary,</a>
ERDDAP has the two sustainability features that matter most: 
<ol>
<li>ERDDAP is a small project (small enough to be handled by one person), so it doesn't require massive resources.
<li>ERDDAP is Free and Open Source Software, so no one can ever stop you or anyone else 
  from working on ERDDAP.
</ol>
I cannot think of a better situation. 
I hope that relieves any fears you (or anyone else) had about ERDDAP's sustainability. 
If you hear people questioning or discouraging the use of ERDDAP because there is just one 
developer, please set them straight by pointing them to the above discussion at this URL:
<a rel="bookmark" href="#sustainable">http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/information.html#sustainable</a> .
<!-- (&lt;sarc&gt;Or, if you would be more comfortable paying $1,000,000 a year
for ERDDAP development, please contact me. I sure we can work something out.&lt;/sarc&gt;) -->

<p><b><a name="cite">How</a> to Cite ERDDAP in a Paper</b>
<br>If you want to cite ERDDAP itself in a scientific paper, please use something like
<pre>
Simons, R.A. 2015. ERDDAP. http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap . Monterey, CA: NOAA/NMFS/SWFSC/ERD.</pre>

<p>Please always separately cite the dataset: see the "creator" attributes in the dataset's global metadata. Please include the URL of the dataset in ERDDAP so people know how you accessed the data.  

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><a name="acronym">What</a> does the acronym "ERDDAP" stand for?</b>
<br>"ERDDAP" used to be an acronym, but it outgrew that original description.
Now, please just think of it as a name, not an acronym.

and evaluation of data distribution systems can be found

<a rel="help" href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html"><b>Set Up Your Own ERDDAP Server</b></a>
and serve your own data.
<ul>
<li>The small effort to set up ERDDAP brings many benefits.
<li>If you already have a web service for distributing your data, you can set up ERDDAP
  to access your data via the existing service or via the source files or database.
  Then, people will have another way to access your data and will be able to download
  the data in additional file formats or as graphs or maps.
<li>If you have datasets that are in high demand, you can install
  <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/grids.html">multiple ERDDAPs
  that work together</a> to scale up and meet the needs of a large data
  distribution center.
