When you install ERDDAP on your server, many of the settings can be left as is.
Settings that you MUST change are in this top section.

<!-- bigParentDirectory is the absolute path on the server (with slash at the end)
to a directory on a drive with lots of space. 
You must create a new directory, outside of the tomcat directory, for this purpose.
The user that runs Tomcat must have read/write privileges for this directory.
Subdirectories that will be created by ERDDAP are: 
* datasetInfo (which some datasets use to cache information about the dataset
   to speed up reloading the dataset in the future), 
* flag (where you can put a file with a datasetID's name to force reloading of 
   that dataset) and 
* cache (which ERDDAP uses to hold cached data files - ERDDAP periodically
   removes files older than cacheMinutes).
The ERDDAP log file (log.txt) will be put in this directory.
At ERD, we use '/u00/cwatch/erddap/' for releases.

<!-- baseUrl is the start of the public url, to which "/erddap" 
is appended. For example:
For running/testing on your personal computer:
  <baseUrl>http://localhost:8080</baseUrl>     
  (127.0.0.1 doesn't work with authentication=google).
For ERD releases, we use
  <baseUrl>http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov</baseUrl>    
If you want to encourage all users to use https (not http), 
  make the baseUrl the same as the baseHttpsUrl (see below).
-->
<baseUrl>http://localhost:8080</baseUrl>

<!-- This is a variant of <baseUrl> which is used when 
authentication is active and the user is logged in.
In general, you take the <baseUrl>, change "http" to "https", 
and change/add ":8443". This must begin with "https://".
If you make a proxy so that ":8443" isn't needed, 
then don't use ":8443" here.
This is relevant even if <authentication> is "".

<!-- Daily status reports and all error messages are emailed to emailEverythingTo.
Daily status reports are emailed to emailDailyReportsTo.
Either of these can be not specified, blank (specified but with no value), 
  a single email address (e.g., john.doe@noaa.gov),
  or a comma-separated list of email addresses.
The first emailEverythingTo email address is more important than the others,
  e.g., it is used for subscriptions to EDDXxxxFromErddap datasets.
See the email account settings below.

Whether or not you set up the email system, all potential email messages 
are logged to an emailLogYEAR-MONTH.txt file in [bigParentDirectory]/logs/.
-->
<emailEverythingTo>nobody@example.com</emailEverythingTo>
<!-- optional: 
<emailDailyReportsTo>your.boss@yourInstitution.edu</emailDailyReportsTo>
-->


<!-- Email account information is used for sending emails to the 
'emailEverythingTo' and 'emailDailyReportsTo' email addresses above
and for sending emails related to subscriptions. So if you don't setup the 
email system, your ERDDAP won't support subscriptions (including allowing other
ERDDAP's to subscribe to datasets on your ERDDAP).

If you don't want your ERDDAP to send emails, change the emailSmtpHost tag 
contents to be nothing.

It is a security risk to put your email password in a plain text file like this.
To mitigate that problem, we strongly remommend that you:
1) Set up an email account just for ERDDAP's use, e.g., 
   erddap@yourInstitution.org 
   That has other benefits as well: more than one ERDDAP administrator can then
   be given access to that email account.
2) Make the permissions of this setup.xml file rw (read+write) for the user who 
   will run Tomcat and ERDDAP (user=tomcat?) and no permissions (not read or
   write) for the group and other users.

emailProperties is a list of additional properties in the form 
  prop1|value1|prop2|value2
The default is nothing.

If possible, set this up to use a secure connection (SSL / TLS) to the email server.

For gmail (even your.name@noaa.gov accounts which are managed by Google), 
  for emailSmtpHost, use smtp.gmail.com
  for emailSmtpPort, use 587
  for emailProperties, use mail.smtp.starttls.enable|true

Whether or not you set up the email system, all potential email messages 
are logged to an emailLogYEAR-MONTH.txt file in [bigParentDirectory]/logs/.

If you can't get ERDDAP to send emails (error = "Connection refused")
and you are using anti-virus software (e.g., McAfee) make sure McAfee 
"Virus Scan Console : Access Protection Properties : 
Anti Virus Standard Protections : 
Prevent mass mailing worms from sending mail" is un-checked.

<!-- Normally, if you have a EDDGridFromErddap or EDDTableFromErddap 
dataset in your datasets.xml, it will try to subscribe to the remote 
ERDDAP dataset so that the local dataset is kept perfectly up-to-date.

IP address will change soon, or you have some other reason, 
you can tell this ERDDAP to not try to subscribe to the remote

This is the overall setting for this ERDDAP. It can be overridden by
the same tag (with a different value) in the datasets.xml chunk for 
a given EDD...FromErddap dataset. 
For each fromErddap dataset that doesn't subscribe to the remote

  otherwise, 'original' is strongly preferred.
  The advantages are that with any number of datasets it works fast

  But there are many things that might go wrong with individual 
  queries and with the whole system. 
  And although its behaviour (the datasets it finds and the order that
