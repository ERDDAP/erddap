#Attributes are plain text, verbatim from schema.

#I think '"' in .nc attributes is trouble, so I changed to '.

StartJulianDay = short\fioos_category=Time`comment=For samples/observations/record events that were taken over time this gives the start ordinal day of the year for the collecting event; i.e., the number of days since January 1 of the same year. (January 1 is Julian Day 1.). Should be an integer from one to 365, i.e. of the form (([0-3][0-9][0-9)|([0-9][0-9)|([1-9])).
EndJulianDay = short\fioos_category=Time`comment=For samples/observations/record events that were taken over time this gives the end ordinal day of the year for the collecting event; i.e., the number of days since January 1 of the same year. (January 1 is Julian Day 1.).  Should be an integer from one to 365, i.e. of the form (([0-3][0-9][0-9)|([0-9][0-9)|([1-9])).
StartTimeofDay = double\fioos_category=Time`units=hours`comment=For samples/observations/record events that were taken over time this gives the start time of day of the collecting event expressed as decimal hours from midnight local time (e.g. 12.0 = mid day, 13.5 = 1:30pm)
EndTimeofDay = double\fioos_category=Time`units=hours`comment=For samples/observations/record events that were taken over time this gives the end time of day of the collecting event expressed as decimal hours from midnight local time (e.g. 12.0 = mid day, 13.5 = 1:30pm)
TimeZone = String\fioos_category=Time`comment=Indicates the time zone for the Time of Day measurements
StartLongitude = double\fioos_category=Location`units=degrees_east`comment=For samples/observations/record events better represented as line features rather than point features (e.g. extended trawls or transects) this indicates the starting longitude location from which the specimen was collected. Express in decimal degrees (East & North = +; West & South = -). GPS-derived data must use the WGS 84 geodetic reference system (http://www.wgs84.com/). [-180 to 180]
EndLongitude = double\fioos_category=Location`units=degrees_east`comment=For samples/observations/record events better represented as line features rather than point features (e.g. extended trawls or transects) this indicates the starting longitude location from which the specimen was collected. Express in decimal degrees (East & North = +; West & South = -). GPS-derived data must use the WGS 84 geodetic reference system (http://www.wgs84.com/). [-180 to 180]
StartLatitude = double\fioos_category=Location`units=degrees_north`comment=For samples/observations/record events better represented as line features rather than point features (e.g. extended trawls or transects) this indicates the starting latitude location from which the specimen was collected or in which the sample/observation/record event occurred. This value should be expressed in decimal degrees (East & North = +; West & South = -). GPS-derived data must use the WGS 84 geodetic reference system (http://www.wgs84.com/).
EndLatitude = double\fioos_category=Location`units=degrees_north`comment=For samples/observations/record events better represented as line features rather than point features (e.g. extended trawls or transects) this indicates the starting latitude location from which the specimen was collected or in which the sample/observation/record event occurred. This value should be expressed in decimal degrees (East & North = +; West & South = -). GPS-derived data must use the WGS 84 geodetic reference system (http://www.wgs84.com/).
Start_EndCoordinatePrecision = double\fioos_category=Location`units=m`comment=An estimate of how tightly the locality was specified in the Start/End Latitude and Longitude fields; expressed as a distance, in meters, that corresponds to a radius around the latitude-longitude coordinates. Use NULL where precision is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable.
DepthRange = String\fioos_category=Location`comment=For data sets that have the depth range expressed in one field (e.g. '150-200 m') it can be entered here as free text.  Separate, numeric Minimum and Maximum Depth fields are the preferred format; the Depth Range option is included for legacy data sets.
Temperature = double\fioos_category=Temperature`units=degree_C`comment=The temperature recorded with the collection/record event. Is assumed to be taken at the collection depth. Expressed in degrees Celsius.
LifeStage = String\fioos_category=Biology`comment=Indicates the life stage present. Will require developing a controlled vocabulary. Can include multiple stages for a lot with multiple individuals.
ObservedIndividualCount = int\fioos_category=Other`units=count`comment=The number of individuals (abundance) found in a collection/record event.
SampleSize = String\fioos_category=Other`comment=Sample_size: the size of the sample from which the collection/observation was drawn.  It can be a volume (e.g. for a phytoplankton sample), a linear distance (e.g. for a visual transect or net haul), a surface area (e.g. for a benthic core), etc.  This field must also include the units, e.g. 200 mfor a transect, or 0.25 m^2 for a benthic grab (use ^ to denote a superscript).  Note that when multiple collections/observations are reported from the same physical sample, a code identifying the sample can be placed in the Field_Number field to allow all collections/observations from a single sample to be connected.
ObservedWeight = double\fioos_category=Biology`units=kg`comment=The total biomass found in a collection/record event.  Expressed as kg.
GMLFeature = String\fioos_category=Other`comment=Geographic Markup Language(GML) description of the feature for representing complex shapes such as lines and polygons, per Open GIS Consortium (OGC) standards - http://www.opengis.net/gml/01-029/GML2.html.
