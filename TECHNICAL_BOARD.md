# **Technical Board**

The ERDDAP™ Technical Board is responsible for the technical direction that ERDDAP™ takes. The ERDDAP™ Technical Board is responsible for the technical direction of ERDDAP™. It makes decisions on prioritization of work, feature roadmaps, dependencies, any processes that impact development work, and any other matter which requires technical supervision in ERDDAP™. The board will also review and approve design documents for significant new features.Technical board terms are 2 years with the option of extending. Technical board members are also expected to be contributing to the project, in particular through pull requests and code reviews.

## **Purpose**

The Technical Board is responsible for the following documents and processes:

* **Review and Approve new features** that are proposed in GitHub Discussions.

* **ERDDAP™ Priority Projects** list, which determine projects that we are working on. Check out the current [priority projects list](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap/issues/158).

* **ERDDAP™ Release Feature Goals**, which determine specific features which we aim to include in each release of ERDDAP™. These are documented in the GitHub project for each release.

* **ERDDAP™ Style Guide** which specifies coding styles and practices to be followed in ERDDAP™ code.

The ERDDAP™ Technical Board operates on the following basis:

* Where possible communication of the Technical Board should be public and asynchronous. In many cases this means utilizing GitHub Discussions and Issues.

* When a meeting of the Technical Board is needed, notes should be published.

* Technical Board meetings are open to all interested parties, but the Board seeks only to find consensus amongst Board members, and representatives from the team that submitted the proposal.

* Nominations for the Technical Board will be considered every quarter at regular SIG meetings. Chris John, as NATD, is responsible for nominating candidates, and a vote of the SIG will be conducted to select, or veto, the final membership. Appointments are made for a period of two years.
